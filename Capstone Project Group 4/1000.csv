"The institutional murder of the Tribal Rights Activist, Father Stan Swamy","Stan Lourduswamy, known as Father Stan Swamy, 84, passed away on Monday afternoon in Mumbai’s Holy Family Hospital. He was arrested on 8th October 2020 for his alleged involvement in the 2018 Bhima Koregaon violence and since then has been in the Taloja Prison, Mumbai.

He had been admitted to the private hospital for a month as he was tested positive for COVID-19.


Lawyer Mihir Desai, who has been representing Swamy since his arrest, held the National Investigation Agency and the Taloja Central prison responsible for Swamy’s death. Taloja Prison evidently failed to provide basic medical facilities to Swamy. Being the oldest prisoner arrested in the Koregaon case, he had continuously been complaining about his declining health conditions for over 10 days before finally getting shifted to Holy Family Hospital on 30th May 2021. He was being moved in and out from the ICU back to the prison all this while till he finally was put on ventilator support where he succumbed to a cardiac arrest.


A failed administration was majorly responsible for his death, which could have easily been avoided. He already suffered from advanced Parkinson’s disease and every time his health deteriorated or he needed any medical assistance, the order of the court was necessitated. Even when he needed access to a sipper for drinking water. 


His condition in the jail was not any good. Being frail and fragile, he was dependent on the co-prisoners for the smallest of things. He could not participate in prison activities. His pleas regarding his failing health were constantly ignored all this while. 


Both the state prison and NIA firmly opposed him getting shifted to a private hospital till Desai fought a long legal battle and the High Court intervened. The petitions to get an urgent interim bail were also denied by the NIA and Taloja prison. 


His death could have easily been avoided. We have lost one of the most important Human Rights Activists of India. May his soul rest in peace and his institutionalized murder gets avenged well.

Men dominated the human space flight,"We human beings have been venturing into space since October 4, 1957, when the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (U.S.S.R.) launched Sputnik, the first artificial satellite to orbit Earth. This happened during the period of political hostility between the Soviet Union and the United States known as the Cold War.
The first human in space was the Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, who made one orbit around Earth on April 12, 1961, on a flight that lasted 108 minutes. A little more than three weeks later, NASA launched astronaut Alan Shepard into space, not on an orbital flight, but on a suborbital trajectory—a flight that goes into space but does not go all the way around Earth.
The number of people heading into orbit peaked in 1985 at 62, 58 of whom were male and four of whom were female. While space exploration has been male dominated, women are increasingly making their prescence felt and in 2017 and 2018, two women lifted off along with seven men.

Webseries review: RAY,"The first thing to admire in Ray is the gorgeous animated title sequence, created by improper design and animation studios. The anthology series features four films inspired by the short stories of Satyajit Ray. These stories filled with twists, whimsy, and humor showcase the frailties of men. Women might prod or even propel the plot, but the focus of these stories is male protagonists grappling with neuroses, breakdown, arrogance and insecurities. Like most anthologies ray is a mix of dazzling and mediocre. The standout is Abhishek Chaubey’s ‘Hungama hai kyo Burpa’. The title comes from a celebrated Ghulam Ali ghazal in which the poet asks ‘Chori to nahi ki daka to nahi dala’ while chori is precisely what this story hinges on. The story is a witty meditation on the eccentricities of human nature, destiny and time. 
At one point of story Aslam says ‘ YE JO WAKT HAI NA MIYA, BADI KUTTI CHEEZ HAI’  the vicissitudes of life can’t be controlled or, the story asks, can they? One of the pleasures here is the language. It’s so soothing to hear the Musafir’s mellifluous expressions. There is a certain romance about stories set on trains, because the journey is at once, literal and metaphorical. The idea of chance encounter with strangers is in itself, thrilling and mysterious.
Bahrupia and Forget Me Not both directed by Srijit are deliciously dark and twisted stories elevated further by terrific performances of Kay Kay Menon & Ali Fazal .Both are about men who slowly become unhinged and lose their connection to reality. The actors are both solid but the story telling is overripe. There is no room for nuance here everything is underlined. 
Found the last episode Spotlight to be a tad underwhelming It distills the absurdity and comedy of showbiz and spirituality. But spotlight doesn’t offer any new insight. And there isn’t enough meat or wit here to sustain the duration at a little over an hour, this is the longest film in the anthology
 The idea of contemporary director interpreting Ray’s writing is instantly magical, but this anthology is just too uneven to do it justice. Available on Netflix India.","Entertainment, pixstory, netflix, review, web series, ray"

Weaver Ant,"Weaver ants are truely a friendly pest control agent. Weaver ants live in trees and are known for their unique nest building behaviour where workers construct nests by weaving together leaves using larval silk. These ants are highly territorial and workers aggressively defend their territories against intruders. Because they prey on insects harmful to their host trees, weaver ants are sometime used by farmers as natural biocontrol agents against agricultural pests. Although weaver ants lack a functional sting they can inflict painful bites and often spray formic acid directly at the bite wound resulting in intense discomfort.

"Stan Swamy no more, he passed away before Bombay High Court took up his bail plea","Jesuit priest and activist Stan Swamy, an accused in the Elgar Parishad-Maoists links case, passed away on Monday, his counsel informed the Bombay High Court when the court took up his bail plea.


Earlier his friend and colleague Father Joseph Xavier had told a website, “Fr Stan was put on ventilator early Sunday morning and is in critical condition.” 

In October last year, the NIA had arrested Fr Swamy from Ranchi in the Elgar Parishad case and imprisoned him in Taloja jail for nine months, where he contracted Covid-19. 

Already suffering from Parkinson’s Disease, he was shifted to Holy Family Hospital in Bandra on May 28 after the intervention of Bombay high court.

Afghanistan doesn’t look good at all,"American troops and their Western allies have left the base at the center of the sprawling war in Afghanistan, effectively ending major US military operations there after nearly two decades.

NYT reports that a contingent of 650 troops will remain to protect the American Embassy in Kabul. The top US commander, General Austin Miller, will remain for “at least a couple more weeks,” a Pentagon spokesman said, as President Biden signals to Afghans that the US is not abandoning them.

The withdrawal on Thursday happened with little fanfare and no public ceremony, and in an atmosphere of grave concern over the Afghan security forces’ ability to hold off Taliban advances across the country.

Some US intelligence estimates predict that the Afghan government could soon fall to the Taliban, who are inching closer to Kabul after having taken about a quarter of the country’s districts in the past two months. President Ashraf Ghani and his aides have become increasingly insular, and the city is vibrating with unease and trepidation.

Things are not looking good at all, especially for India. The best case scenario is a civil war between the ANF and the Taliban while the worst case scenario is complete control of the Taliban, with global recognition and Pakistan support. New Delhi is opening lines of communication to all actors but it may be already too late to make a difference. A civil war may keep everyone preoccupied with Afghanistan but a total Taliban rule will have serious implications for India, including in Kashmir. What role will China play? That will be an important factor. Essentially, it is a period of flux in Afghanistan which is going to pose serious challenges for India as the neighbourhood is pushed into a vortex of radicalism and violence.",afghanistan

Why Ghulam Nabi Azad will not become the LoP again even after returning to Rajya Sabha?,"There is a buzz that the ruling DMK in Tamil Nadu is willing to concede one of the three vacant Rajya Sabha seats to the Congress and especially to former Leader of the Opposition in the Upper House Ghulam Nabi Azad.

Azad retired from the Rajya Sabha in February this year and the party could not re-nominate him because there was no vacancy from any state. 

Now, there are few, including one in Maharashtra following the death of Rajeev Satav due to Covid-19. The Congress is likely to name party veteran and another dissident leader Mukul Wasnik from that seat. 

Coming back to Azad, if he gets elected to the Rajya Sabha from Tamil Nadu with the DMK's help the moot question is will he become the LoP again? 

Highly unlikely, say a number of Congress leaders. They argued that it will be extremely difficult for the Congress High Command to remove present LoP Mallikarjun Kharge given that he is not only a senior leader but also a Dalit. 

So, removing a Dalit from the post will be suicidal for the Congress at a time when the party is desperately trying to woo the members of the Scheduled Caste community. 

Besides, assembly elections are going to be held in five states - Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur - in February-March next year. 

The Congress cannot afford to antagonise the Dalits at this critical juncture and give the rival political parties a handle to attack it.

So, will Azad agree to become a Rajya Sabha member but not the LoP? 

There is not much he or the Congress leadership could do in this case. Either he has to accept it or leave it. 

In the recent past, Azad has shown much interest in the politics in Jammu and Kashmir. He led the Congress delegation at the all-party meeting called by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on June 24.

But Congress leaders also suggested that given his concerns regarding his official accommodation Azad might consider taking the offer and also simultaneously keep himself busy in Jammu and Kashmir affairs. 

So, all eyes on Azad and his future moves.","congress, dmk, tamil nadu, maharashtra, ghulam nabi azad, mallikarjun kharge, mukul wasnik, rajya sabha"

TABOOS: Morning-after Pill,"In the movie Lipstick Under My Burkha, the character Shireen Aslam has one problem: a randy husband who refuses to wear a condom. Since Shireen doesn't want to fall pregnant, she has to resort to popping morning-after pills. 

They are called the I-PILL (or Unwanted-72), and sold on the Indian market at Rs. 100 a packet. The first time I came across them, I was surprised by their price (the morning-after pill in India is relatively much cheaper than in the US or the UK, where it can cost up to 25 GBP). 

As a result, I saw girls buying them to 'stock', as if they were candy instead of something that could cause severe disruptions in their hormonal cycle. The I-pill is NOT meant to be used as a regular contraceptive: it cannot replace hormonal birth control. But it's perhaps not surprising that they are being used as such in a country where sex education is so woefully lacking, and in a country in which ""Are you married?"" is a euphemism for ""Are you sexually active?"" 

Women would rather buy medication quietly, even if it's potentially dangerous medication, than have to engage in uncomfortable conversations where they are judged and harassed for simply addressing their reproductive needs.","sex education, taboos, morning after pill"
16. khaki files –  I pleaded for mercy for my dear friend's killer,"Devil’s Advocate continues ………….

On 20 April 2011, Sheila Dikshit, the then chief minister (CM) of Delhi, chaired a meeting of the Sentence Review Board. Cases of convicts serving life sentences in Tihar Prisons were to be considered for commutation. 

Other members of the board included the principal home secretary, the judicial secretary, the district and sessions judge, the chief probation officer, the joint commissioner of police of crime, and sundry other officials. 

After the board reviewed two or three other cases, Manjeet’s matter came up for discussion. As on the five earlier occasions, when his case had been considered and rejected, once again the entire board was of the opinion that he deserved no mercy. After all, he had killed an eminent advocate in cold blood, only because he (the advocate) was doing his duty as a special prosecutor. The most vocal amongst the board members were the judicial secretary and the sessions judge, who considered themselves to be members of the same fraternity as the deceased victim. 

The board was unanimously firm that Manjeet should breathe his last within the confines of Tihar. For a ruthless criminal like him, life sentence meant life sentence, period.

Finally, having heard everyone else, the chief minister turned to me for my view. I informed the board that if anyone in the room should oppose the commutation of Manjeet’s life sentence tooth and nail, it should be me. I gave the CM and the others present the background of my association with Gurcharan Singh, how he had come to our rescue when all seemed lost and how beholden I was to him till date. Yet, ironically, it was I who was pleading for mercy for my saviour’s killer.

I went on to say that I had observed Manjeet Singh from close quarters. I had always found him to be disciplined and well behaved. Most importantly, I felt he was at peace with himself and the world. During the nineteen years that he had spent in prison, there had been no complaints against him.

15. khaki files –Devil’s Advocate – Does a murderer deserves a second chance?,"Devil’s Advocate continues ………….

Under Indian law, people who are sentenced to life imprisonment become eligible for a review of their sentence after fourteen years. The remaining part of their sentence can be waived or commuted by the Sentence Review Board, which is appointed by the Government of Delhi. I learnt that Manjeet’s case had come up before the board five times 
and had been repeatedly rejected. The board was meeting next on 20 April 2011. My 
presence, as the head of Tihar Prisons, was required at the meeting, as the ex officio member secretary.

It had been close to five months since I had taken over as the director general of prisons. I had learnt a lot about the punishment, reformation and rehabilitation of convicts during this time. From being a hardened cop, whose mission in life was to send offenders behind bars, I had begun to see things ‘from the other side’ and in a very different light. I had realized that there was much more to dealing with criminals than sending them to jail. We had to reform them and give them another chance at an honest life. They were, after all, human beings, many of whom had committed crimes under circumstances that had forced them to take the law into their own hands. If during their imprisonment they showed signs of repentance, remorse and the desire to be reformed, they deserved rehabilitation and integration with mainstream society.

Once again, I called upon the jail superintendent and his support staff and asked them to share their thoughts on the commutation of Manjeet’s sentence. They told me that they were all of the opinion that the remaining part of Manjeet’s sentence should be commuted. But they were sceptical of a favourable verdict from the Sentence Review Board, as his case had been rejected five times.

God is within us: This is how I fee it!,"Each religion tells us the ways to reach God. At the same time God resides within each of us.
 God is inside me. This is one reason why people bring luck to others. This feeling of having God inside us makes us positive, daring and gives one the feeling it is possible. 

In Hindi language it is said “kar sakte”which translates into I can do it. The daily of people is centred around this feeling of God within.

 Living our daily life is also a way to God. I learnt so much from this land of ancient wisdom and where everyday life is so intricately linked to reflect the God within. I can feel it as a 'yogini' when I do asanas (body postures), or movement in kalaripayattu, the martial art. I think at the top the mountain is the same, but do remember there are many ways to climb that mountain. Though there are many ways that we can take to reach the top of the mountain, the top remains the same. Similarly, to reach God, people use different ways—some use dance, some pooja. This divine feeling also helps us to be helpful to others. When I was in India, as I wrote about it earlier, so many people helped me. Unknown people, strangers, my classmates. When I was attending Kalaripayattu classes, I got accompanied to the bus terminal in Chennai. It is not because I was a foreigner, but because my teacher was particular that students are well taken care of.  ","dance, god"
The Artist Story | Sam Haynes,"Sam Haynes is a mid-career visual artist based in London, working primarily with sculpture and public art installations. She is interested in the physicality and materiality of forms, and the translation into a more accessible and friendly medium for a wide and diverse audience. 
Her abstract, geometric assemblages often incorporate found objects and materials which aim to reference different domestic settings and architectural spaces. This is reflected in the physical and geographical adaptability of Haynes’s practice, in terms of exhibiting and installation.

""As an artist that initially felt isolated and uncomfortably distanced from everyday life working within a studio, I started my practice over twenty-five years ago creating site-specific public art installations, engaging local communities with the belief that art has the power to bridge divides within society. The creative process is still all about making connections for me, within my practice as an artist facilitator, as well as a collaborator and sculptor. Accessibility lies at the heart of my work, incorporating found objects and materials, using low-tech methods of construction to create abstract assemblages that reference domestic and architectural space.

My mixed media work combines a rhythmical, systematic design and geometric structure with softer, flexible elements that take shape more organically. I am led primarily by an intuitive response to these contrasting or opposing materials, leading to often unexpected outcomes. These playful interactions, surprising and yet familiar, seek to create a sense of balance and tension, building dynamic connections between materials and the surrounding space, animated through the use of colour, light, and shadow.

I have been strongly influenced by the artwork of Action Space’s learning disabled artists, Linda Bell and Nnena Kalu. Their abstract, process-led installations show an honest and direct response to materials, free from conventional constrictions; an approach that I seek to mirror within my own sculptural practice."" - Sam Haynes","art, artist, arts therapy, arts, artillery fire, art galleries, art collector, artists, artist art"
Three students from KIIT make it to Tokyo Olympics squad,"Three students from KIIT make it to Tokyo Olympics squad

Three students – sprinter Dutee Chand, fencer CA Bhavani Devi and javelin thrower Shivpal Singh - from KIIT Deemed to be University, in Bhubaneswar, Odisha, have made it to the Indian squad for the Tokyo Olympics, starting from July 23.

It will be a second consecutive Olympic appearance for Dutee Chand, a law student at KIIT, who qualified in two events - women’s 100m and 200m sprints - on the basis of her world ranking. An Arjuna Awardee athlete and national record holder in 100m, Dutee had earlier won two silver medals at the 2018 Asian Games.

CA Bhavani Devi, who is pursuing Ph.D. degree at KIIT, is the first Indian fencer to ever qualify for the Olympics. She secured qualification in the women’s sabre event at Tokyo 2020 Olympics through the adjusted Olympic rankings, following the World Cup in Hungary in March this year. Ranked 42nd in the world, she made history by becoming the first Indian to win a gold medal at the Senior Commonwealth Fencing Championship in Australia in 2018 in the sabre event.

Javelin thrower Shivpal Singh, a BBA student at KIIT, qualified for his maiden Olympic Games by achieving the qualification mark with a throw of 85.47m at the ACNW League Meeting in South Africa in March this year.

“KIIT is the only university in the country to send three athletes to the Tokyo Olympic Games,” said Dr Achyuta Samanta, Member of Parliament (Lok Sabha) and founder, KIIT & KISS. “KIIT and KISS have been able to achieve such unique distinction as they have been promoting sports and games in a big way among the students since their inception. KISS has produced 5000+ sports talents at the state, national and international levels, including medal winners at the Commonwealth Games, Asian Games and World University Games,” added Dr Samanta.  

Apart from the three students, Dr Sudeep Satpathy of Kalinga Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS) has been selected as the Doctor of the Indian men’s hockey team for Tokyo Olympics. This will be a second successive appearance in Olympics for Dr Satpathy. ","olympics, odisha, tokyo olympics, dutee chand, ca bhavani devi, shivpal singh, dr achyuta samanta, kiit"

"How race, sex and class combine to affect school results","When it comes to education, we cannot think about race, sex and class in isolation. When I was commissioned by the UK government to investigate how these issues affect academic achievement, I discovered how they all matter – and in combination. I believe that an analysis that focuses on any one of these in isolation will inevitably miss important aspects of inequality.

I was tasked with analysing inequalities in educational achievement – specifically at age 16 – as part of the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities’ report which was published in March. The issue has been raised again recently by a report from the House of Commons education select committee that highlighted the educational outcomes of white working class children in particular.

Sixteen is when pupils sit their GCSEs and statutory full-time education in England ends. It is an important transition. The qualifications they achieve at this stage are key to their future outcomes at every level: educational, economic, health and wellbeing.

I looked at what historically have been the three central dimensions of inequality: race, sex and class (or socio-economic status). I used the Department for Education’s second longitudinal study of young people in England. This nationally representative sample of 10,000 young people sat their GCSEs in 2015/16, and is the most up-to-date and comprehensive data on race, sex, class and achievement at age 16.

The data showed that how well pupils do at GSCE level is related far more to social class – as assessed by parental occupation, education and household income – than to race or sex. For example, the achievement gap between pupils from the 20% of homes with the highest household income and the 20% of homes with the lowest household income was very large (measured at 0.91 standard deviations or SD). It was over three times larger than the small gap between boys and girls (0.29 SD), and over eight times larger than the very small gap between black and white pupils (0.11 SD). (Standard deviations are a unit of measurement used in statistics to gauge how far any given data point is from the average, or mean.)

Eating more vegetables, adequate protein , healthy fats ( mustard oil, sesame oil, olive oil, virgin coconut oil,  butter & desi ghee ), & variety of whole grains like millets & unpolished  rice as per your individual needs .
Eating more fibre & fermented foods helps with healthy gut & limit sugar , processed foods with toxic ingredients, salt & pesticides laden food .

EXPLAINER 
Eating well- is the life time top for good health. Stay healthy , stay fit  guidelines is mainly a matter of choosing the right foods to eat. 
The main focus should be on limiting the amount of fat, saturated fatty acids, and cholesterol that you eat; eliminating added salt from your diet; eating more complex carbohydrates; eating a moderate amount of protein; and cutting down on your consumption of added sugars. 

With all the above, you have to exercise enough to balance out what you eat .","Food, Health, healthy diet, diet tips"

Need to help those who served you,"Covid has impacted everyone's lives but the MSMEs are most impacted. During the lockdown not that they left out of the business but their Financial needs increased. Their source of income was lost. Many Milk factories shut down. Facing the financial crisis they decided to shut down their factories. However, the fiscal stimulus introduced by the government, policies and initiatives introduced by them to help the MSMEs. The government's capital infusion to PSB banks helped few. But the reach wasn't helpful enough to reach a larger mass. A lot of MSEs are agitated. They are asking the government for financial support because the current policies are not reaching them. Maybe the amount given to them isn't sufficient for fulfilling operating costs and other functionalities. 
Government has also asked to support Swawlamban and focused towards Self- reliant India. Recently we have also acknowledged the MSMEs on 27th of June, the MSME Day. So we need to support them. 

There could be some small stores near you as well who require some finances. We should try to help them in this difficult time. We can buy something from them or help out with some cash if possible. Because they are in a bigger crisis than us. They must have served you in lockdown as well. If their stores will shut down then they will have nothing. They will run out of business. Their family will starve. Even if you cannot help someone with finances, help them with government initiatives. In that way also we can help them out.

There may be a temporary blip in menstruation but Covid vaccine doesn’t affect fertility,"On Sunday Karnataka made news after some women reported being denied Covid-19 shots in the vaccinations . The reasons they were menstruating and health workers thought there may be vaccination complications.
While the news was all over India media, let me put the story in context. 
As soon as the vaccination drive started in India, various social media messages warned women of not taking the jabs during periods. 
After a while some people started sharing stories about blip in periods on social media. 
However does it happen? 
There is no evidence suggesting so. If u go for a jab the healthcare worker might list, fever , nausea , headache as symptoms but period complications would find no mention. 
Anthropologist Dr Kathryn Clancy at the University of Illinois spoke on Twitter about how her period arrived early and heavier . After receiving numerous comments says the same she started a survey- results are awaited. 
However what most researchers say is that some people might experience a temporary blip but doesn’t mean it will be a long term effect or even affect fertility. 
The HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccine and the flu vaccine have been reported to affect menstrual cycles temporarily so it wouldn’t be surprising of COVID-19 vaccines do so briefly either. 
Read a very interesting explanation in a piece on iavi website . It’s explains how Immune cells are at work in the creating and then breaking down the lining of the uterus that happens during menstruation; vaccines produce inflammatory molecules called cytokines and interferons that stimulate immune cells, including potentially in the uterus. So the lining might be shed more vigorously post vaccination. 
Does it affect fertility? 
No , a study of more than 35,000 people who were pregnant when they received their vaccine showed that there are no increased risks of severe side effects or adverse pregnancy outcomes from either the Moderna or Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines. The study was done by Centre for Disease Control and Prevention and published in the New England Journal of Medicine . 
So women need to just take their shots and relax .","Health, covid 19, vaccination, menstruation, menstrual health"

Europe is running out of semiconductors – here’s what it can learn from tech survivor Osram,"The shortage of semiconductor chips has exposed the vulnerability of European high-tech manufacturers that rely heavily on chip imports from Asia. The automotive sector alone, traditionally a European high-tech stronghold, is expected to take a US$110 billion (£79 billion) hit over the coming years as a result.

In 2020, high-tech products represented approximately 20% of total exports from the European Union by value, with other major sectors including pharmaceuticals, telecoms, aerospace and armaments. Enjoying annual growth rates upward of 10% before the semiconductor shortage and employing more than 3.5 million workers, high-tech is the fastest growing European industry by far.

Considering the importance and apparent vulnerability of the sector, the EU is scrambling to implement initiatives to encourage domestic chip manufacturing and reboot innovation at home. After all, Europe accounted for about 44% of global semiconductor manufacturing in 1990, compared to only around 10% today. This slow decline was the result of manufacturers failing to adapt after domestic first-generation cellphone makers Nokia, Ericsson and Siemens were usurped by American and Asian competition.

Yet in the midst of this struggle for technological self-sufficiency, a European powerhouse in high-tech manufacturing was created by the acquitision of German LED (light-emitting diode) manufacturer Osram by Austrian sensor specialist AMS. The combined company is among Europe’s largest semiconductor firms and holds the largest market share in chips supplied to the automotive sector.

It is the latest in a series of mergers and takeovers in semiconductors that are representative of what has been happening in high-tech industries as a whole. Products which were once the exclusive domain of western manufacturers have become increasingly commodified as Asian manufacturers catch up, boosted by government subsidies that have left established companies struggling to compete. Yet at the same time, highly profitable and strategically important niche applications are emerging, which point to opportunities.

To understand why some companies have failed to adapt to a rapidly changing business environment, while others are driving innovation, it’s worth looking at the history of Osram in more detail.

"Illegal since 1961, dowry system still flourish in india: World Bank study","Dowry payments in India's villages have been largely stable over the past few decades, a World Bank study has found.

Researchers looked at 40,000 marriages that took place in rural India between 1960 and 2008.

They found that dowry was paid in 95% of the marriages even though it's been illegal in India since 1961.

The practice, often described as a social evil, continues to thrive and leaves women vulnerable to domestic violence and even death, a report in BBC said. 


Paying and accepting dowry is a centuries-old tradition in South Asia where the bride's parents gift cash, clothes and jewellery to the groom's family.

The study was based on dowry data from 17 Indian states that contain 96% of India's population. It focussed on rural India since a majority of Indians continue to live in villages.

Economists S Anukriti, Nishith Prakash and Sunghoh Kwon used information on value of gifts - cash and kind - received or given at the time of marriage.

They calculated ""net dowry"" as the difference between the value of gifts given by the bride's family to the groom or his family and those given by the groom's family to the bride's family. The groom's family had paid more to the bride's family in a very small number of marriages.
They found the average net dowry had been ""remarkably stable"" over time, with some inflation before 1975 and after 2000.

And the researchers found that a groom's family spends on average about 5,000 rupees ($67; £48) in real terms in gifts to the bride's family.

The gifts from the bride's family, unsurprisingly, cost seven times more at about 32,000 rupees ($429). This implied an average real net dowry of 27,000 rupees ($361).

Dowries consume a substantial proportion of household savings and income: in 2007, the average net dowry in rural India was equivalent to 14% of annual household income.

""As a share of income, dowry has gone down over time because on average rural incomes have risen in India,"" said Dr Anukriti, an economist at the World Bank Research Group.","india, dowry"

'Save America' Party moves to Florida,"A day ahead of the Fourth of July, the country's former president Donald Trump on Saturday held his much anticipated ""Save America"" campaign-style rally at the Sarasota Fairgrounds in Florida. He criticised New York prosecutors for indicting his company, the Trump Organization, and his longtime financial adviser, Allen Weisselberg, in what he called ""prosecutorial misconduct"". The event will also feature a grand fireworks display to mark the occasion of the US Independence Day on July 4, news agencies reported.

""They've mobilized every power of government to come after me, my family, my wonderful employees, and my company solely because of politics,"" Trump told the crowd gathered at the rally.

Notably, this is the former president's second ""Save America"" rally, the earlier being held in Ohio near the end of last month. There, Trump had dissed US president Joe Biden's performance as a ""catastrophe"" and criticised the current administration for the crime wave in major cities throughout the United States, the migrant crisis at the southern border with Mexico, and a dismal economic situation marred with high inflation.

Three classic Euro semi- final matches from past,"1. 1960 semi-final  France 4-5 Yugoslavia

The first ever game at a EURO finals set a thrillingly high standard, though there was little hint of the avalanche to come as half-time neared at the Parc des Princes. The two teams were locked together at 1-1, but François Huette fired Les Bleus in front on 43 minutes and he later added a second to make it 4-2.

Yugoslavia, it seemed, were beaten. Instead, they had a shock in store for the home side, plundering three goals in the space of five minutes in what remains the competition's highest-scoring match.

2. Yugoslavia 2-4 West Germany, 1976

Holders West Germany were heading for defeat in Belgrade until Helmut Schön made one of the most inspired substitutions of all time. Danilo Popivoda and Dragan Džajić had earned a 2-0 lead for the hosts, who were still looking strong after Heinz Flohe's deflected effort reduced the deficit.

That all changed when Schön brought on the uncapped Dieter Müller 11 minutes from the end. With his very first touch, the debutant sent the game into extra time where he scored twice more to cap an unlikely comeback win. He also scored in the final as West Germany lost on penalties to Czechoslovakia.

3. France 3-2 Portugal (aet), 1984

After missing out in 1960, the French eventually made it through to their first final 24 years later. Dominant for long periods thanks to the artistry of Michel Platini, they struck first through Jean-François Domergue and appeared poised for a routine victory until Rui Jordão nodded in on 74 minutes.

The same player then volleyed Portugal ahead in extra time, but Platini teed up Domergue to level and clipped in the winner himself with a minute left to spark euphoric scenes at the Stade Vélodrome.",football
How a Chennai-based artist is fighting vaccine hesitancy?,"At a time when there is universal consensus about vaccines being the only weapon to tame the spread of coronavirus and prevent another deadly wave, the problem of vaccine hesitancy is also a reality.

Environment: Why a massive Antarctic lake vanished in three days?,"Antarctica recorded a new high temperature of 64.94 degrees Fahrenheit (18.3 Celsius) in 2020 according to the scientists with the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).

Despite the world pledging to limit warming, the Antarctic continues to see higher temperatures each passing year. WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas noted that the record was “consistent with the climate change we are observing.” [https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2021/07/02/antarctica-record-high-temperature-wmo/]

And we can see already the consequences. For instance, a study published in the Nature journal in May said that a global temperature rise of 3 C would lead to an ""abrupt jump"" in the pace of Antarctic ice loss that could trigger ""rapid and unstoppable"" sea-level rise.

Strong evidence in that regard has come as a large ice-covered lake in Antarctica vanishing within three days. Although the disappearing act happened in 2019 and the scientists discovered it recently through satellite imagery, the speed with which it happened has surprised some scientists. [https://aappartnership.org.au/scientists-detect-sudden-loss-of-large-antarctic-lake/]

The Amery Ice Shelf in East Antarctica drained about 21 billion to 26 billion cubic feet (600 million to 750 million cubic meters) of water into the ocean. When ice-shelves of such large size turn to water, they lead to rising in sea levels.

Is climate change responsible for the event at Amery Ice Shelf? The scientists are not jumping to conclusions as such incidents called 'hydrofracturing' do take place regularly. But it is also a fact that more Antarctic ice shelves are melting with rising air temperatures. Recent projections by scientists warn that future warming for Antarctica could result in more 'melt lakes.'

Unless the world acts fast to control carbon emissions and limit global mean warming in the twenty-first century to less than 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, there could be a ""rapid and unstoppable sea-level rise,"" the Nature study said. [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03427-0] One could witness more unprecedented events like the one at Amery Ice Shelf more regularly.

One of the best things I’ve done for my mental health: Adult colouring,"Let me start by saying, I’m onto colouring a snake sketch now, and the day I started it, I dreamt about snakes (horned vipers), that too a brilliant green, blue one. Just goes to show into it I was. 

I loved colouring this dapper, horse with lush mane. I was, am going through a difficult time in life right now and this has helped me calm down, it has meditative properties, so don’t watch something while doing it (preferably), if you concentrate well, how the pencil colours feel when they come into contact with the paper, does the paper feel smooth or rough, how do you feel about the trippy colours? 

Remember when you had to colour that hut brown and that apple red? Hell with it. I feel great letting my inner artist nurture. The horse has 40 shades? So be it. Like Priyanka Chopra’s character in The Sky is Pink says, “If you think the sky is pink, then the sky is pink!”

Critically endangered antelope saiga makes comeback,"The population of a rare type of antelope has more than doubled since 2019, in a remarkable turn around in fortunes.

According to the first aerial survey in two years, the number of saiga in their Kazakhstan heartland has risen from 334,000 to 842,000.

There were fears the animal was on the brink of extinction following a mass die-off in 2015.

Distressing images of carcasses strewn over the steppes made world headlines.

Following a series of conservation measures, including a government crackdown on poaching, and local and international conservation work, numbers have started to bounce back.

That, together with the natural resilience of the species, gives hope for their future, said Albert Salemgareyev of the Association for the Conservation of Biodiversity of Kazakhstan (ACBK).

""They give birth to twins every year, which gives high potential for the species to quickly recover,"" he told BBC News.

The saiga has seen a dramatic turnaround in fortunes. But even with the current boom, numbers will never return to the millions estimated in Soviet times due to looming threats, including the impact of state infrastructure projects and oil and gas development, said Albert Salemgareyev.

The latest survey, carried out in April, shows not only a big increase in the total numbers, but that one particular population in Ustyurt in the south of the country, has made a dramatic recovery.

In 2015, there were barely more than 1,000 animals left in the area, but there's been a big increase to 12,000 in this year's census.

Last wilderness

The UK-based non-profit organisation, Fauna & Flora International, has been involved in efforts to protect the Ustyurt population by establishing a new anti-poaching ranger team and using satellite collaring to monitor saiga movements.

David Gill, FFI senior programme manager for Central Asia, said the new census was the best evidence yet that decades of conservation efforts to protect the saiga were paying off.

But he warned against complacency, saying saiga migrate across huge areas, so future development and infrastructure projects that might fragment its habitat remain a concern.

Another Bollywood couple announced their DIVORCE....,"Bollywood actor Amir Khan and his wife Kiran Rao have announced their divorce. The couple has been married for 15 years now and has a son named Azad Rao Khan. In a statement released on July 3, the celebrity couple announced they will no longer live as ‘Husband and Wife’. In these 15 beautiful years together we have shared a lifetime of experiences, joy and laughter, and our relationship has only grown in trust, respect and love. Now we would like to begin a new chapter in our lives — no longer as husband and wife, but as co-parents and family for each other,” said Rao and Khan. The couple revealed that their separation was planned some time ago and are formalizing the agreement now. The couple said that they will continue to collaborate on films and projects. They also thanked their family and friends for supporting their decision. Amir Khan and Kiran Rao met on the sets of lagan where the Rao was an assistant director. They had tied the note on December 28, 2005. In 2011 the couple welcomed their son Azad Rao khan through surrogacy, nearly 6 years after their marriage.

Khan was previously married to Reena Dutta and has two children from his first marriage. Khan and Dutta had separated after 16 years of their marriage in 2002.
It might sound simple, but it's not easy for a husband and wife to decide to end a marriage. Often they spend a long time trying to solve problems before deciding to divorce. But sometimes they just can't fix the problems and decide that a divorce is the best solution.

4th July - USA imported bulk of fireworks from China in 2020,"After a relatively quiet Fourth of July in 2020, America is getting ready for a mega celebration this year.

Despite the pandemic, the U.S. fireworks sector imported just under $370 million worth of pyrotechnics in 2020, the bulk of which came from China. Last year Chinese bottle rockets, roman candles and other fireworks arriving into the country were worth a collective $359 million, according to data from the UN Comtrade Database.

However, there’s also a darker side to the bright shining mega-lights as a  U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission analysis found that 18 people died in non-occupational fireworks incidents in the U.S. in 2020, an increase on 12 deaths recorded in 2019.
66% of all fireworks injuries in 2020 occurred around the Fourth of July period, documented between June 21 and July 21 with the main culprits being firecrackers and sparklers.

Most buildings were designed for an earlier climate - global warming makes it difficult now,"Climate change will affect every aspect of our lives – including the buildings we live and work in. Most people in the US, for example, spend about 90% of their time indoors. Climate change is fundamentally altering the environmental conditions in which these buildings are designed to function.

Architects and engineers design buildings and other structures, like bridges, to operate within the parameters of the local climate. They’re built using materials and following design standards that can withstand the range of temperatures, rainfall, snow and wind that are expected, plus any geological issues such as earthquakes, subsidence and ground water levels.

When any of those parameters are exceeded, chances are some aspect of the building will fail. If there are high winds, some roof tiles may be ripped off. If, after days of heavy rain, the water table rises, the basement might flood. This is normal, and these problems cannot be designed out entirely. After the event has passed, the damage can be repaired and additional measures can reduce the risk of it happening again.

But climate change will breed conditions where these parameters are exceeded more often and to a far greater degree. Some changes, like higher average air temperatures and humidity, will become permanent. What were previously considered once in a century floods may become a regular occurrence.

Some of these impacts are fairly obvious. Houses will be more prone to overheating, putting the lives of residents at risk, which is what has happened during the recent “heat dome” over North America. Flooding will happen more often and inundate greater areas, to the point that some places might have to be abandoned. The village of Fairbourne in Wales has already been identified as a likely candidate. Failure to act on both of these threats in the UK was highlighted in a recent report by the Climate Change Committee.

Remembering Swami Vivekananda: “By serving others we serve God”,"Swami Vivekananda was a truly inspiring leader who taught us that all living beings are an embodiment of the divine self; therefore, service to God can be rendered by service to humankind. This teaching was embraced by Judeo Christians and many other religious groups as it is also a dearly held core Judeo Christian belief as shown here.

Brazil: Is the vaccine scandal becoming too hot to handle for Bolsonaro,"A Brazilian congressional investigation known as CPI had President Jair Bolsonaro on the mat already on his alleged bungled handling of the Covid-19 situation in the country. Now comes another allegation that almost threatens to sweep him out of office.

Claims of corruption involving members of Bolsonaro's administration while buying the Covid vaccine from an Indian manufacturer has thousands of Brazilians on the streets asking for the President's impeachment.

Bolsonaro has already fired a health ministry official who allegedly demanded the bribe for the vaccine deal to go through, but that hasn't had much of an impact as the opposition and many people on the street allege that Bolsonaro probably knew of corruption before it exploded in public.

For instance, Luis Miranda, a legislator whose brother works in the health ministry, claimed they had alerted Bolsonaro about the deal with India's Bharat Biotech on the multi-million-dollar deal. [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/01/bolsonaro-brazil-vaccine-covid-scandal]

With a court allowing a criminal probe, many skeletons could tumble out in the coming weeks and months. [https://www.euronews.com/2021/07/03/brazil-court-approves-corruption-investigation-into-bolsonaro-over-vaccine-deal]

While some call for impeachment proceedings against the President, Bolsonaro is confident of riding out this storm. Several political experts in Brazil feel that the Vaccine-gate may weaken Bolsonaro, but he has the numbers in the parliament to avert impeachment going through.

Right-wing Bolsonaro, who rode to power on the promise of fighting corruption, has been unpopular for his handling of the covid crisis. Almost half a million Brazilians have died so far and the pandemic is yet to be brought under control. [https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/19/americas/brazil-covid-deaths-intl-cmd/index.html]

The impeachment may not happen, but if the corruption scandal lingers, it may threaten Bolsonaro's re-election attempt next year. He still has his base strongly backing him, but he will need more than his supporters to win the elections.

"My first posting cancelled, I waited in Hyderabad for next orders, no news came for many days","Down The Memory Lane....

Having reported at Hyderabad and staying in one room at Police Officers Mess, I waited for further orders. 

I had requested the DGP that I may be posted to any district as my child was small and it would not be a problem. 

However, there was no news for many days. Then one day I was called and informed that, I have been posted as Deputy Commissioner of Police –Secunderbad (North Zone).  

I had no choice but to follow the order knowing that no official residential accommodation was available in Hyderabad. 

Even though it was considered one of the most peaceful zone of Hyderabad Police Commissionerate, the job was challenging having huge railway establishment, large Cantonment area and Airport within its jurisdiction. 

One of the regular routine was to receive and see off visiting dignitaries at the Hyderabad Airport. 

An incident, which I would always remember, is worth recalling. I was on a visit to a relation of mine, who stayed in old Hyderabad with family on a Sunday. I have travelled in my personal car having informed my control room that I would be away for three to four hours. 

Those days there were no mobile phones and wireless sets were installed in official cars......

16. Dial D for Don Gifts from the Gulf- The road to bring Aftab back is not easy,"“Gifts from the Gulf” continues…

Our Consulate in Dubai had put me up at Hotel Sheraton Jumeirah Beach with spectacular views of the waterfront except that I had no time to stand and stare. It so happened that a horde of press reporters from Delhi were staying in the same hotel to cover an international conference. I ran into one of them in the hotel lobby. The word of my presence spread amongst others. They all wanted to know what was going on and what had brought me to Dubai. Somehow, I could ward them off saying I was there for an Interpol meeting.

 On the morning of February 9 I was taking a walk on the cornice near the hotel when I was informed by my Director that a special aircraft of the Government of India was on its way to Dubai. I was ecstatic. When the flight arrived later the same day, a CBI team of five officers headed by Deputy Inspector General of Police AK Gupta of Interpol, Delhi deputed to assist me was brought by the Consulate staff to the same hotel where I was staying. I briefed the officers that they had to lie low and, as far as possible, stay indoors. 

The following morning i.e. 10th February we were driven to a relatively less used terminal of the Dubai International Airport in Consulate vehicles. Reserved for chartered planes and flights leaving for Pakistan, it wore a deserted and eerie look. In fact, it was this terminal where Aftab had been arrested before he could board a flight to Islamabad. We were seated in the VIP lounge of the terminal not sure of what was going to happen next and when.

"I think, therefore I understand.","What is an endearing moment for you? Where you feel unhindered, relaxed, calm, where your thoughts meet you and you get to know yourself, where you think.
For me it is sitting solemn and looking at the moon that is glimmering with pride, in that nightlight i speak to myself.
It is in that moment, I get the time to think, away from the chaos and judgement.
It is then I ask myself the questions whose answers would make me know my essence.
Those are the moments of introspection. When I revisit every thought, image, conversation. ""Today was a different day, I didn't speak well to my mother, I couldn't complete my task, I was not good enough, am I on the right path, perhaps it would all be connected to how my day began, the little altercation with my mom.""
These questions fills up my mind, I take it all one by one, I talk to myself, it is then I realise and comprehend the choices I made and the things I did. In these moments of self reflection, I forsake every thought that piqued me earlier, it is then I learn and ingrain the values that would make me know my existence and essence.
Sometimes just thinking and understanding makes it easier, I think therefore I understand, I think therefore I know my essence, I think therefore I am.","introspection, thoughts, consciousness"

What is it about Indian American kids and Spelling Bee?!!,"What is ‘vitelligenous’? (Something that produces the yolk of an egg.) What is ‘cataplexy’? (Sudden loss of muscle power after an emotional stimulus.) A bunch of eighth graders answered these and other questions with words too difficult to read. After nine rounds, there are 11 left in contention for the finals of the US Spelling Bee [http://spellingbee.com/], to be held on July 8. Here’s an easy question? Which is the community with the highest number of finalists? Indian Americans, of course.

When it comes to getting the spelling of words like ‘lophophytosis’ and ‘asterixis’, there seems to be something required in brain functioning that kids of families originally from India have got in ample measure. Nine of the 11 finalists are Indian-Americans, continuing the community’s near-monopoly over the competition. [https://www.ndtv.com/indians-abroad/scripps-national-spelling-bee-finals-9-indian-americans-among-11-us-spelling-bee-finalists-this-year-2474734] 
Since 2008, every Scripps bee competition has had an Indian (or South Asian) American child as the champion. 

The bond between the competition and the community is growing stronger. The community has founded companies that provide coaching for spelling contests, there are special contests tailored to the community. Flyers for local bees get maximum mileage when distributed at Indian supermarkets or temples.

It all started in 1985 with Balu Natarajan (now 49) becoming the first child of immigrants to win Scripps, and the whole community rejoiced over it. Something fell in place and it clicked. Ever since, generations of Indian American students have made dictionaries their best friends. [https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/03/style/spelling-bee-south-asian-americans.html]

What could be behind Indians’ special ability with the English language? Indians do have a way with the Queen’s Language, after long years of the British Raj. In the world of literature and culture or software development, they have succeeded among all non-native-English speakers. In India, it is the preferred language as medium of education for the aspiring classes, and it is a marker of ‘having arrived.’ Plus, there could be the inclination for hard work that Indian Americans are known for.

Kota: First taste of independence,"I still vividly remember the day I stepped foot on the Kota Station alongside my parents, boarded a taxi, booked a hotel for my mother and brothers to stay, while my father accompanied me to the main branch of Allen Institute and got me admitted there. I had never seen him sign a check as assuredly as he did then before handing it at the counter. This moved me. Before I could process my admission and the future I had ended up signing for, we were boarded on a taxi, this time with my mother and brothers as well, to visit the Allen branch I was allotted, Sangyan. Within moments on reaching there, we checked out a nearby hostel, and rented a room for my stay. Everything was happening so fast, I couldn't comprehend the profoundness of it all. Couldn't believe I was going to thrive alone here, without my parents continual watch that I was so used to. Ofcourse, I was mentally prepared for the grit and grind of studying for a competitive exam. But at the same time, I was eager to explore life independently and this felt no less than an open opportunity. While I couldn't wait for my dream to realise quickly, I was reluctant when it came to parting with my parents. Specially my father,  I could see his eyes brimming with trust and hope for my wellbeing. So far, untill now my experience at Kota might not have been up to my expectations but that brief moment where my father vulnerably and silently expressed his confidence in me, has stayed with me as a reminder for all that I am supposed to be. Yes, this is what Kota most reminds me of.","father, kota, neet aspirant, self belief, hostel, allen institute"

Science denial: Why it happens and 5 things you can do about it,"Science denial became deadly in 2020. Many political leaders failed to support what scientists knew to be effective prevention measures. Over the course of the pandemic, people died from COVID-19 still believing it did not exist.

Science denial is not new, of course. But it is more important than ever to understand why some people deny, doubt or resist scientific explanations – and what can be done to overcome these barriers to accepting science.

In our book “Science Denial: Why It Happens and What to Do About It,” we offer ways for you to understand and combat the problem. As two research psychologists, we know that everyone is susceptible to forms of it. Most importantly, we know there are solutions.

Here’s our advice on how to confront five psychological challenges that can lead to science denial.

Challenge 1: Social identity

People are social beings and tend to align with those who hold similar beliefs and values. Social media amplify alliances. You’re likely to see more of what you already agree with and fewer alternative points of view. People live in information filter bubbles created by powerful algorithms. When those in your social circle share misinformation, you are more likely to believe it and share it. Misinformation multiplies and science denial grows.

Action 1: Each person has multiple social identities. One of us talked with a climate change denier and discovered he was also a grandparent. He opened up when thinking about his grandchildren’s future, and the conversation turned to economic concerns, the root of his denial. Or maybe someone is vaccine-hesitant because so are mothers in her child’s play group, but she is also a caring person, concerned about immunocompromised children.

We have found it effective to listen to others’ concerns and try to find common ground. Someone you connect with is more persuasive than those with whom you share less in common. When one identity is blocking acceptance of the science, leverage a second identity to make a connection.

"Could India have saved 100,000 lives during Covid second wave?","India’s death toll from the Covid-19 crossed the 400,000 mark this week. The virulent resurgence in infections during the second wave from March this year has contributed maximum in spiking that figure. Up to 100,000 of the lives lost could have been saved if effective movement restrictions were put in place in time, concludes a new research study.

“[H]ad action taken place at any time in March, it is plausible that more than 90% of observed cases and deaths between March 1-May 15 could potentially be avoided under both strong and moderate intervention scenarios,” concludes a team of scientists.

The paper: ‘Resurgence of SARS-CoV-2 in India’ 
https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.23.21259405v1.full

India is placed the third, behind the US and Brazil, in the death toll, whereas in terms of the number of infections (30 million), it is second only to the US. [[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-57676223]] These figures are vastly underreported, expert says, partly due to the logistic constraints and lack of diagnosis, partly due to the authorities’ efforts to claim their interventions were effective. [https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/explained-why-indias-covid-19-data-is-vastly-undercounted/articleshow/82366707.cms] [https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/24/world/asia/india-coronavirus-deaths.html]

The second wave of March-May could have been averted if the leadership and people had maintained a cautious attitude after the previous peak of September 2020 instead of a sense of complacency. After January, with the start of the vaccination campaign, India felt as if full normalcy had returned, and several super-spreader events were held and allowed: A cricket match had 100,000+ spectators, the months-long holy Kumbh festival attracted millions in a small town, elections to five states had huge crowds in campaign rallies. [https://www.firstpost.com/india/kumbh-mela-and-election-rallies-how-two-super-spreader-events-have-contributed-to-indias-massive-second-wave-of-covid-19-cases-9539551.html] Precautionary measures were put in place at such events, but there were routinely flouted. When cases started rising, touching even 400,000 a day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi maintained a nationwide lockdown, like last year, would be only a last resort, so as to let the economy recover. [https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/pm-modi-on-covid-second-wave-has-hit-like-a-storm-i-feel-the-pain-of-healthcare-workers-2418164] It was left to the states to impose local shutdowns.

“We argue that enhanced genomic surveillance along with constant assessment of risk associated with increased transmission is critical for pandemic responsiveness,” notes the paper by the multidisciplinary team with several Indian scientists.

COVID hit entertainment,"Soon when Covid hit us. People enthusiastic about entertainment were in trouble. They wanted to watch something new and didn't want to change the routine. At this the boost of OTT platforms launched a new hope for the entertainment seekers. Not just this but new OTT platforms were created for regional languages and regional creators. Sudden change in viewership increased. People are more inclined towards paying subscriptions and enjoying the service for a longer time. Yet we don't know when the situation will be better. 
Netflix is now every next door word. Amazon Prime, Sony Live, MX player, Disney plus hotstar are now in every phone. Then binge watching is new youth trend. All this is happening because somewhere people want to escape the Reality. They want to come out of the trauma. Moreover,  the platforms also doing really hard work to provide their best services with the contents. The contents which are coming on such platforms are attracting more viewership. Not only this but there are many actors who were looking for opportunities, became a star overnight. The power that OTT has brought is super powerful.  It is  showing us a different dimension of entertainment. And yes less resources and no box office takrav. The audiences are liking the show and applauding the works which is again amazing and motivating for the actors, directors and producers to work more on good contents and good projects.

Satish Agnihotri: Right Man for the Right Job,"Satish Agnihotri has taken charge as Chairman cum Managing Director of the National High Speed Rail Corporation Limited (NHSRCL) at a rather critical juncture. The completion deadline of the Mumbai-Ahmedabad HSR project - described as Prime Minister Narendra Modi's pet scheme - has reportedly been stretched forward by five years: From 2023 to 2028. Project costs have spiralled, while the Indian and Japanese government (project financer) have been unable to thrash out the arithmetics on revised costs. Execution tasks have apparently become tougher because of the Uddhav Thackeray government's apparent reluctance in parting with the land required for the project in Maharashtra.

Hopes in official circles seems to rest on such a premise: That Agnihotri - a 1982 batch officer of the Indian Railway Service of Engineers (IRSE) - would be able to bring about the same kind of a turnaround that he had so successfully executed in the Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL) during his stewardship of the organisation for close to nine years. During his tenure as the Chairman cum Managing Director, the RVNL was awarded the ""Mini Ratna""status for the first time in 2003 and achieved the rating of "" Excellent performance""for nine consecutive years. From revenues of Rs. 1445 crores in 2010-11 - the year Agnihotri joined as CMD - the figures shot up to Rs. 8000 crores in 2017-18 - an increase of as much as 453 percent. During the period, the RVNL completed 7000 km rail lines including 3000 km of doubling/third line, 880 km of gauge conversion and 3000 km of rail electrification. In settling upon the candidature of Agnihotri, the policy makers were apparently influenced by another fact: That, amongst all his peers, Agnihotri is the only officer to have had a consistent and intense involvement with  India's high speed plans. From July 2012 to August 2018, he functioned as the Chairman of the High Speed Rail Corporation - the precursor of the HSRCL. After the Appointments Committee of Cabinet approved his selection on June 8, Agnihotri took charge as NHSRCL Managing Director on July 1.

"Is that Princess Diana statue an “awkward, lifeless shrine”?","The just-unveiled statue of Princess Diana flanked by three children is evoking strong responses. Prince William and Prince Harry had commissioned the statue in 2017, hoping it would help viewers “reflect on her life and her legacy”. The work by well-known sculptor Ian Rank-Broadley has instead divided fans and art critics. One commentator has said it is an “awkward, lifeless shrine”.

The Dukes of Cambridge and Sussex, the estranged brothers, united to unveil the statue of Princess of Wales in Kensington Palace’s redesigned Sunken Garden, on her 60th birth anniversary.

Jonathan Jones, art critic for the Guardian, was aghast. “The sentiment splurges across the flower beds like an uncontrolled wail of artistically absurd pathos. A larger than life Diana, who stands in an awkward, stiff, lifeless pose and has a face that’s more manly than I remember, modelled apparently with thickly gloved hands and no photo to consult, protects two children in her arms while a third lurks behind her.” He found it a “religious image that shamelessly plays up to the most mawkish aspects of Diana worship.” Comparing it to the image of the Virgin Mary in Christian art, he wrote, “So this sculpture invites us to see Diana as a modern Mary…” [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/jul/01/the-diana-statue-ian-rank-broadley-sculpture]

Other critics are not so harsh. Ruth Millington found “nothing overly sentimental” in the statue. “With this poignant memorial, the artist has created a characterful depiction of Diana, which does her justice.” Elizabeth Fullerton saw it as “an uncontroversial, accessible representation of a female icon” – though “pretty conservative.” [https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-57684597]

Among mediapersons, Piers Morgan, the former Good Morning Britain host, said he was not impressed. He tweeted: “Let’s be honest – it’s not a great statue of Diana.” [https://metro.co.uk/2021/07/02/princess-diana-statue-piers-morgan-criticises-monument-14862513/] Another presenter, Davina McCall, tweeted, “I really wanted to like it. But somehow… it doesn’t feel very Diana? Her joie de vivre… her radiance, her compassion. It feels stiff.” Then she deleted the tweet. [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/davina-mccall-princess-diana-statue-b1877547.html]

Fans offer their own interpretations. Some feel the statue is “elegant”, “beautiful, just like she was” and the children surrounding Diana symbolise the fact she was “full of love.” One believes the front profile doesn't do her justice.

"To build bridges with Mamata, Congress first needs to remove Adhir as West Bengal Chief","Media reports on Sunday suggested that the Congress is keen on building bridges with the Trinamool Congress and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and for that it is willing to remove Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury as the party's leader in the Lok Sabha. 

But the reasoning cited in the reports defied the logic. 

Chowdhury is a known detractor of Banerjee and was appointed the West Bengal Congress President in September last year, barely some months ahead of the assembly elections. 

So, when the Congress appointed him it had made abundantly clear that the party was not in favour of having any alliance with Banerjee. 

His appointment had also then triggered speculation on whether he would continue to hold the post of the Congress leader in the Lok Sabha, going by the party's one person-one post norm. 

It is also well known in the Congress that Rahul Gandhi had always been in favour of doing business with Banerjee but had to succumb to the pressures of the state leaders. 

Even this time, Congress workers in West Bengal were divided over the support to the Left Front as some wanted an alliance with the Trinamool Congress. 

During the just-concluded assembly elections, the Congress had to distance itself from Chowdhury's unsavoury remarks against Banerjee. 

Chowdhury had said that Banerjee was indulging in “siyasi pakhand (political hypocrisy)"" when she got injured during campaigning in Nandigram. 

Senior Congress leaders had also objected to having a tie-up with the Indian Secular Front founded by the cleric of Furfura Sharif Abbas Siddiqui. 

The move was seen as trying to divide Banerjee’s support base among minorities and a one that could have helped the BJP. 

The alliance with the Left parties didn't help the Congress this time as the grand old party failed to open its account in the assembly elections - perhaps for the first time since Independence. 

After the elections, Chowdhury did try to mend fences with Banerjee by saying the Congress should not contest bypoll against her.

But by removing Chowdhury in Delhi and retaining him in West Bengal don't seem to be a move that will help in improving ties with Banerjee.","Politics, congress, mamata banerjee, trinamool congress, west bengal, adhir ranjan chowdhury"
Cong veterans from Bihar meet in Delhi for state unit reshuffle,"Ahead of the much-delayed reshuffle in the Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC), senior leaders of Bihar Congress on Friday met at the Delhi residence of former governor and party stalwart Nikhil Kumar, where they are believed to have discussed campaign to install a new BPCC president in place of Madan Mohan Jha who had offered to resign after the 2020 Assembly polls taking moral responsibility for the party’s poor performance.
Among hose present were former Lok Sabha speaker Meira Kumar, former BPCC chief Anil Sharma and former Congress legislature party (CLP) leader Ashok Ram.
Several state Congress leaders are said to be restive over plans to make Kutuma legislator Rajesh Ram as the state unit chief. AICC in-charge of Bihar, Bhakta Charan Das, is said to have suggested Rajesh Ram’s name for the top party post in the state.
When contacted, Anil Sharma refused to share details of what was discussed at the meeting.
However, one of the leaders present at the meeting said, “More would join hands to refurbish the state unit in a way that catapults the Congress as a force to reckon with in the state instead of being a pillion rider.”

Tagging Sharma’s tweet, Das replied, “He was happy to learn that the party seniors have expressed their serious concerns about its affairs of Bihar through this meeting.”
Earlier, some senior leaders of the state Congress had met AICC leaders in Delhi to scuttle the move to make Rajesh Ram the next party chief in Bihar.
Some other senior leaders, it is reliably learnt, are also planning to visit Delhi to meet AICC leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi to rally for a “strong, energetic leader acceptable to all” as the next BPCC chief once the Punjab and Rajasthan issues were favourably resolved.

AICC general secretary Tariq Anwar, Rajya Sabha member Akhilesh Prasad Singh, former governor Nikhil Kumar, former MLA Ashok Kumar, Bihar Pradesh Mahila Congress Committee chief and former MLA Amita Bhushan, former BPCC vice-president Pravin Kushwaha, working president Samir Kumar Singh and MLC Prem Chandra Mishra are said to be potential contenders for the state chief’s post.

Troubles galore for BJP ahead of Goa assembly polls,"Panaji: With a little more than six months to go for the assembly polls, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Goa appears to be facing a problem of plenty.

Ever since central BJP observers like national organising secretaries BL Santosh and CT Ravi have started making the rounds of the coastal state to lay the groundwork for the party for the upcoming polls, a clash of sorts seems to be emerging from two sections of candidate aspirants within the party — the loyal faithful and the new imports.

Former Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar, former Sports Minister Ramesh Tawadkar and Sidharth Kuncalienkar, an MLA and a close aide of late Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar, among others have all started jostling for a ticket in the upcoming polls, refusing to heed notes of caution from top state BJP leaders and CT Ravi as well.

Their demands for tickets have only grown more shrill, ever since Ravi, last month, held one-to-one consultations with sitting BJP MLAs, nearly half of whom have joined the party from the Congress and the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party since 2017.

The most confident salvo was fired by Parsekar, who has said that he has formally informed BL Santosh about contesting the 2022 assembly polls from the Mandrem assembly seat in North Goa.

“I have informed him about my intention to contest the next assembly election,” Parsekar said.

Parsekar’s bete noire, Dayanand Sopte, who defeated the former Chief Minister in 2017 while contesting the polls on a Congress ticket, is now a sitting BJP MLA and is unwilling to cede any ground.

In the Canacona assembly segment, former Sports Minister Tawadkar has now thrown his hat into the ring, demanding a ticket in place of sitting MLA Isidore Fernandes, who was elected on a Congress ticket, but switched to the BJP in 2019.

"Coaching hub of India, Kota crumbling under Covid pressure","Kota: The educational hub of India, Kota, with an estimated worth of Rs 1,200 crore before the Covid-19 pandemic, has now been reduced to one-fourth of its value, due to the new variant which has forced students to leave the city and resort to online studies. Thousands of caterers, hostel and PG owners have been left in the lurch, looking for alternate livelihoods.

Around one lakh people engaged directly or indirectly with the coaching hub have lost their livelihood.

Four decades back, Kota was an industrial city of Rajasthan. However, later, it transformed into a premier coaching centre of the country as aspiring students dreaming of making it big in medical and technical streams came here.

Each year, around 1.50 lakh students from all over the country register themselves at various institutes here. However, now the town wears a desolate look as hardly 10-15% students have stayed back.

“It is like a nightmare for us when hundreds and thousands of students have left Kota in fear and haste. The city’s economy has crumbled. Only 10 per cent of the hostels and PGs have students. Around 80 per cent of employees working in these hostels have lost their jobs,” said Naveen Mittal, president of the Kota Hostel Association.

Kota’s 70 per cent economy has been dependent on these students spending around Rs 2 lakh to Rs 2.50 lakh each per annum.

With around 3,000 hostels, over 25,000 PGs, around 1,800 mess and several cafes, tiffin centres, breakfast stalls and other businesses, the city was thriving as a coaching hub. Many residents here converted their homes into hostels and PGs.

Now around 80% mess owners have downed shutters. The president of the Mess Association of Kota Jashmesh Singh said: “Thousands of people have become unemployed and have gone back to their native places. Running a mess for 4-5 students is difficult so most of them have downed their shutters.”

Around 90% students left Kota last year during the pandemic. Many states arranged special buses and trains were also run to take away the students from the city.

Will Congress’ gamble pay off in Telangana?,"Hyderabad: Desperate to revive its fortunes in Telangana, the Congress party appears to have taken a risk by appointing firebrand leader Anumula Revanth Reddy as its new state party chief despite his controversial past and ignoring several strong contenders for the post.

Revanth, who has an ABVP background and joined Congress only four years ago, pipped many senior leaders and loyalists to get the key post.

The 53-year-old leader, known for his aggressive style of politics and considered popular among youth, is seen as someone who can lead the Congress to victory in 2023 elections.

The hopes he will re-establish its connect with the voters in its former stronghold and lead it to power, which remained elusive despite the party granting statehood to Telangana.

The Congress suffered crushing defeats at hands of Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) both in 2014 and 2018. Reeling under a series of defections and after suffering defeats in by-elections and local body polls, the party’s morale is at its lowest.

The choice of Revanth Reddy, however, raised the question whether he can steer Congress party to a victory in country’s youngest state, whose politics has largely been dominated by TRS under the leadership of K. Chandrasekhar Rao popularly known as KCR.

“Across all regions in the country, the is skidding downwards due to lack of strong leadership at various levels. It needed to take some bold decisions and back them with conviction. Appointment of Revanth Reddy is surely a step in the right direction for the party battling for existence,” said political analyst Palwai Raghavendra Reddy.

“Congress would have surely assessed the pros and cons before taking this big decision. Revanth will be accountable for a good show in the state even if some senior leaders leave Congress before 2023 polls.”

Racism lurks behind decisions to deny Black high school students from being topper,"Two Black students – Ikeria Washington and Layla Temple – were named valedictorian and salutatorian at West Point High School in Mississippi in 2021. Shortly afterward, two white parents  questioned whether school officials had correctly calculated the top academic honors.

Ultimately, the school superintendent named two white students as “co-valedictorian” and “co-salutatorian” on the day of graduation.

High school seniors with the highest GPA in their graduating class are chosen to be valedictorians and are often responsible for delivering the graduating speech. Salutatorians, who are high school seniors with the second-highest GPA in their graduating class, often give the opening remarks.

The superintendent attributed the mix-up to a new school counselor who was given incorrect information on how to calculate class rankings.

As an educational researcher who focuses on race and inequality, I am aware that the controversy at West Point High School is by no means isolated.

A history of overlooking Black valedictorians

Back in 1991 a federal judge in Covington, Georgia, resolved a dispute a Black high school senior had with a white student over who gets to be valedictorian by making them share the honor.

Then in 2012 in Gainesville, Georgia, another Black valedictorian was also forced to share the honor with a white student. Later, the white student’s family asked the school to drop his candidacy from the academic honor.

In 2011, Kymberly Wimberly, a Black student in Little Rock, Arkansas, had her valedictorian honor stripped away by her principal to be given to a white student with a lower GPA. Wimberly’s lowest grade during all four years of high school was a B. In the rest of Wimberly’s courses, honors and Advanced Placement courses, she received A’s.

In her lawsuit, Wimberly claimed that a day after being informed that she was the valedictorian for McGehee High School, the principal told her mother, Molly Bratton, that he “decided to name a white student as co-valedictorian.”

I became familiar with these kinds of valedictorian disputes when I examined the 2017 lawsuit of Jasmine Shepard. A student at Cleveland High School in Mississippi, Shepard had the highest grade-point average in her class.

He used these acquaintances and contacts to help cornucopia of people in the country.
Varun tells that this path had so many obstacles"" we got appreciation but more than that there was a lot of trolling on social media, people used to say that we are just doing it all for attention and not genuinely providing help"". 
Despite this the work never ceased, many cases came his way that were challenging and overwhelming.

I got connected with all our units and admitted those three people in the different hospital and arranged cremation for the ones who died, it was quite an appalling case, that child called me to say those three people in his family got saved because of me""he told Pixstory.
Varun says that this was the time when people could have helped in every way no matter what facilities they had instead of vilifying the administration or other people, he tells"" there was a rickshaw puller, I got to know about him that he was helping people reach hospital as the ambulance were taking a large amount of money for few kilometres, he did not have much money but decided to take a huge step"".","covid 19, covid warriors"
14. khaki files - Devil's Advocate: Meeting Manjeet left me emotionally drained,"Devil’s Advocate continues ………….

I asked him in all earnestness, ‘Why did you kill such a nice man?’

‘For the sake of my friendship with Brij Mohan,’ was his cold reply.

The details of the murder that he shared with me were, more or less, known to me. I heard Manjeet out and looked at him, my gaze filled with rage and bitterness. How could he have done it? How did he have the gumption to stand before me and admit that it was he who had pulled the trigger to shoot my defenceless friend? 

I was overcome by a strong desire to get up and do something to him. But Manjeet continued to look into my eyes with meekness and a certain earnestness that was disarming. I couldn’t bring myself to even shout at him. I asked him to leave and returned to my office, emotionally drained.

In the days that followed, I was engrossed in my work  at the prison. Every time I managed a visit to jail number two, I would spot Manjeet going about his work silently and devotedly. 

On a couple of occasions, his request for the grant of parole was presented before me. His case was always recommended by his jail superintendent on account of his good behaviour and his past record of returning from paroles on time and without any complaints during his leave of absence.

In the nineteen years he had served thus far, he had gone on parole several times. Unlike other jail convicts, not once had he jumped parole or delayed his return to jail. 

His behaviour since the day he had arrived at Tihar had been exemplary and the staff  and convicts had great regard for him.

"Vaccines shown to be effective in Delta variant, more studies required for Delta plus","Questions : With the Delta plus variant showing up in many states ? Are the current vaccines good enough for both Delta and Delta plus variants of Covid 19? Recently ICMR Said Delta plus variant escapes monoclonal antibodies .

Dr Anoop Misra’s reply 

It is possible that the Delta plus variant could sidestep immunity generated by vaccines to some extent, however, it is comforting to note that for those who have had vaccines, COVID19 is usually mild. Lesson again is that unvaccinated people are at grave risk when infected with the Delta variant. 
More research is needed for Delta plus variant . 

EXPLAINER 

An ICMR a study which was made public a few days ago says that Those who have recovered from Covid and have got either one or two doses of Covid-19 vaccine have the maximum protection against the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 Virus. The researchers only studied the impact of Covishield , Bharat Biotech also made public their trial three results showing covaxin has 65 percent efficacy against Delta variant.

13. khaki files – Devils’s Advocate : Stood before me was killer of my beloved friend,"Devil’s Advocate continues ………….

The youngster entered Gurcharan Singh’s chamber but with him two other men also sneaked in. Gurcharan Singh, engrossed in a file, raised his head to greet the boy but was startled to see the two men beside him. He recognized them immediately, as they were the ones who had threatened him in court. Before he could react, both of them pulled out their revolvers and shot him at point-blank range, killing him on the spot.

In the melee that followed, Krishna Tyagi slipped out of the room to call the police. The cops reached the spot, investigated the case and identified the killers as Brij Mohan Sharma, Manjeet Singh and Gerard Innis aka Jerry. Manjeet and Jerry were soon arrested by the Delhi Police. Brij Mohan, however, absconded, formed another gang and continued to commit heinous crimes, particularly kidnappings for ransom, mainly in UP.

On 30 July 1991, not even two months after murdering Bawa Gurcharan Singh, Brij Mohan and three of his gang members, kidnapped a property dealer from Jhansi. They asked his family to deliver the ransom money on 5 August at a hotel in Mathura, where the Jhansi Police led by Shailendra Sagar, SSP, had an encounter with the kidnappers. Brij Mohan Sharma was killed in the exchange of fire and the kidnapped person was rescued. Eight years later, on 14 May 1999, the sessions court in Delhi convicted Manjeet Singh and sentenced him to life imprisonment, while Jerry was acquitted. And now, almost nineteen years later, stood before me Manjeet Singh, claiming he was the main killer of my beloved friend.

I stared at Manjeet as he humbly confessed to his crime before me. I wondered if he understood the full import of the ghastly crime he had been a party to. How pulling the trigger of his gun had taken away a precious life, caused acute grief to a family and left a void in the lives of all those who knew Gurcharan Singh.

"This day, 22 years ago: India's first  Wimbledon trophy","In  1999, when Leander and Mahesh followed up on their maiden Grand Slam triumph in the French Open, by beating Paul Haarhuis of the Netherlands and Jared Palmer of the US, 6-7(10), 6-3, 6-4, 7-6(4) in the final.

It may be stupid to ask whether it was a dream realised.

“Honestly, no,” said Bhutaphi later told The Sport Star. 

""It was a dream to play on centre court at Wimbledon, one day. Winning was beyond a dream.”

Such is the aura of Wimbledon, the grass court event steeped in history and tradition that it takes some guts to even dream about conquering it, even for the best of champions.

“Professionally, winning the Wimbledon final was the most memorable match in my life as far as doubles is concerned,’’ he  said.

The captain of the Davis Cup team now, Mahesh went on to win the Wimbledon mixed doubles titles with Elena Likhovtseva in 2002 and Mary Pierce in 2005.

The evergreen Leander who had won the fourth of his Wimbledon mixed doubles titles in 2015 with the Swiss Miss, Martina Hingis, played a clutch of matches at the climax in 1999 over the last two days, owing to wet weather, and bagged the mixed doubles trophy as well with Lisa Raymond. He won two more mixed titles at Wimbledon with Martina Navratilova and Cara Black.

India's name in Wimbledon was heard even longer before that.

"While debate rages over glyphosate-based herbicides, farmers are spraying them everywhere","As North America enters its peak summer growing season, gardeners are planting and weeding, and groundskeepers are mowing parks and playing fields. Many are using the popular weed killer Roundup, which is widely available at stores like Home Depot and Target.

In the past two years, three U.S. juries have awarded multimillion-dollar verdicts to plaintiffs who asserted that glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup, gave them non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a cancer of the immune system. Bayer, a German chemical company, bought Roundup’s inventor, Monsanto, in 2018 and inherited some 125,000 pending lawsuits, of which it has settled all but about 30,000. The company is now considering ending U.S. retail sales of Roundup to reduce the risk of further lawsuits from residential users, who have been the main source of legal claims.

As scholars who study global trade, food systems and their effects on the environment, we see a bigger story: Generic glyphosate is ubiquitous around the globe. Farmers use it on a majority of the world’s agricultural fields. Humans spray enough glyphosate to coat every acre of farmland in the world with half a pound of it every year.

Glyphosate is now showing up in humans, but scientists are still debating its health effects. One thing is clear, though: Because it’s an effective and very cheap weedkiller, it has become pervasive.

How glyphosate went global

When glyphosate was commercialized under the Roundup brand name in 1974, it was widely viewed as safe. Monsanto scientists claimed that it would not harm people or other nontarget organisms and did not persist in soil and water. Scientific reviews determined that it did not build up in animal tissue.

Glyphosate killed more target weed species than any other herbicide before or since. Farmers started spraying it on fields to prepare for the next cropping cycle.

In the 1990s Monsanto began packaging glyphosate with crops that were genetically modified to be resistant to it, including corn, soybeans, cotton and canola. Farmers who used these “Roundup Ready” seeds could apply a single herbicide to manage weeds during the growing season, saving time and simplifying production decisions. Roundup became the highest-selling and most profitable herbicide ever to appear on the global market.

Olympian boxer Manoj wants Dronacharya award for his coach Rajesh,"Olympian boxer Manoj wants Dronacharya award for his coach Rajesh; legendary coach Sandhu and Olympic medalist Vijender Singh backed the claim

Olympian and Commonwealth Games gold medallist boxer Manoj Kumar wants a Dronacharya awardee for his mentor and coach Rajesh Kumar. Manoj’s claim is backed by legendary boxing coach Gurbax Singh Sandhu and Beijing Olympic medallist Vijender Singh.

Second time in a row, former boxing national coach Sandhu has recommended the name of Kurukshetra University’s boxing coach Rajesh Kumar for the country’s highest coaching honour, the Dronacharya Award, for the year 2021.

Rajesh is a coach behind the success of double Olympian and Arjuna awardee boxer Manoj Kumar, who had competed in the 2012 London and 2016 Rio Olympics. Manoj also won gold at the 2010 Commonwealth Games and his last major medal was a bronze in the 2018 Commonwealth Games.

Besides that Rajesh is also credited for producing international medalist and three-time national champion Mukesh Kumar, Youth World champion boxer Vinka and over a dozen international boxers.

“He is one of the few coaches in the country, who are working both at grassroots and at excellence level, starting from talent hunt to producing world class boxers,” stated GS Sandhu in his recommendation to the sports ministry for boxing coach Rajesh.

Rajesh is also an international AIBA two star coach and was the coach with the British franchise ‘The British Lion Hearts’ team in the 2017 World Boxing Series.

“Apart from achieving success in the boxing arena, I am thankful to Rajesh coach sahib for helping me in moving out of poverty. Whatever the lifestyle I am leading today is all because of coach sahib and boxing. Not only me, he has helped many boxers in getting government jobs and majority of these players hail from a very normal family,” says Manoj, who was bestowed with the Arjuna award in 2014. “Rajesh is working at grass root level too and producing top boxers. I want the sports ministry to acknowledge his achievements by bestowing him with the Dronacharya award,” says Olympic medalist boxer Vijender Singh.","Sports, olympics, vijender singh, boxer manoj kumar, dronacharya award, rajesh coach"

Remembering Swami Vivekananda on his death anniversary,"Today is the death anniversary of Swami Vivekananda. 

Always stressing the universal and humanistic side of the Vedas, the oldest sacred texts of Hinduism, as well as belief in service rather than dogma, Vivekananda attempted to infuse vigour into Hindu thought, placing less emphasis on the prevailing pacifism and presenting Hindu spirituality to the West.

 He was an activating force in the movement to promote Vedanta philosophy (one of the six schools of Indian philosophy) in the United States and England. In 1893 he appeared in Chicago as a spokesman for Hinduism at the World’s Parliament of Religions and so captivated the assembly that a newspaper account described him as “an orator by divine right and undoubtedly the greatest figure at the Parliament.” Thereafter he lectured throughout the United States and England, making converts to the Vedanta movement",vivekananda
The ethical questions raised by COVID-19 vaccines: 5 essential reads,"The U.S. is edging closer by the day to seeing half of its population fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Although vaccination rates differs from state to state, the national figure currently stands at 46.4%. That goes up to 57.2% when looking solely at the adult population.

Vaccines were developed across the world in record time. But the rollout had to overcome the hurdles of how to best deliver the vaccine quickly and how to persuade some reluctant communities in America to get the shot.

There have also been ethical dilemmas to navigate in regards to who should get the vaccine first and what to do with people who jeopardize the success of immunization by refusing to take part. And then there is the issue of whether it is morally right that some countries and some groups in society benefit from immunizations before others.

Experts writing for The Conversation have provided guidance on how to approach some of these ethical concerns.

1. It’s never that simple!

At first glance, the question of whether someone can be compelled to be vaccinated should be a fairly straightforward ethical issue – as many have argued, surely people have a duty to get vaccinated. But as moral philosopher Travis Rieder explains, it isn’t that easy.

In fact, it is rather complex. He doesn’t suggest that there aren’t overwhelming reasons to get vaccinated. Only that these reasons do not constitute a “duty.”

Reider asks whether it is right to compel someone to engage in what could be seen as a personal, intimate act. “[Vaccination] involves having a substance injected into your body, which is a form of bodily intimacy. It requires allowing another to puncture the barrier between your body and the world,” Rieder writes.

Presenting the moral case for vaccines as straightforward can be counterproductive.

2. Paying people to get their shot

A majority of Americans have been more than happy to get vaccinated as a way out of the pandemic. But for others, the lure of life returned to normal hasn’t been enough to get them in front of a needle.

Denmark have lost only three of their last 17 international games (W12 D2 L3).

Denmark have only failed to score in one of their last 16 international matches.

"England 4, Ukraine 0: KEY STATS","Key stats

This was England's most emphatic win at a EURO: their previous biggest wins were 4-1 vs the Netherlands at EURO '96 and 3-0 vs Switzerland at EURO 2004.

This was the first time England have scored four goals in a knockout stage match of a major tournament since the 4-2 win against West Germany in the final of the 1966 FIFA World Cup.

This is the third time England have scored four goals in a EURO final tournament game (4-1 win vs Netherlands in 1996 and 4-2 win vs Croatia in 2004).

England have yet to concede a goal at EURO 2020. They had never previously started a major international final tournament with five successive clean sheets, their four to kick off the 1966 World Cup their best until now.

Harry Kane's last 24 goals for England have all been in competitive matches.

Kane is the first player to score twice for England in a EURO knockout match, and first England player to score twice in a EURO final tournament match since Wayne Rooney, against Croatia in 2004.

England have scored within the opening five minutes in four of their last six EURO final tournament knockout phase matches.

England have become the first team to keep five consecutive clean sheets from the start of a EURO final tournament; Spain did record five clean sheets in 2012 but only from their second match onwards.

Maguire scored his fourth goal for England and his second in a major tournament after his effort against Sweden at the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

Jordan Henderson's first England goal came on his 62nd appearance for his country.

Jude Bellingham has become the youngest player to feature appear in a EURO knockout fixture at 18 years and four days old.

Ukraine have only failed to score in two of their last 11 international matches; they are yet to keep a clean sheet in 11 EURO final tournament matches.

This was England’s fourth EURO final tournament quarter-final tie. Each of the previous three finished level and required a penalty shoot-out to decide the outcome (1996 W vs Spain, 2004 L vs Portugal, 2012)",football
'Eye of Fire' in the Gulf of Mexico,"The fire burned for more than five hours before it was extinguished, according to Pemex, the Mexican oil company that controls the pipeline.

Some environmental groups pointed to the fire as a stark example of the risks of relying on fossil fuels as climate change contributes to fatal heat waves across Canada and the Pacific Northwest.

“These are the risks we face on a daily basis and which call for a change in the energy model,” Gustavo Ampugnani, executive director of Greenpeace Mexico, said in a statement.

President of Mexico, López Obrador said he wants to restore Pemex’s former status as a national oil company that made Mexico self-sufficient in energy and provided hundreds of thousands of well-paying jobs.

But critics have warned Mr. López Obrador that he is sinking public money into reviving an industry that is being overtaken by new, cleaner technology.

Pemex has also been troubled by debt, mismanagement and corruption.

In 2019, Pemex carried $107 billion in debt, making it the world’s most indebted oil company.

I'm not saying that we shouldn't recycle or not use paper straws, all I'm saying is that we gotta keep a check on things like these and shift to cleaner energy and technology.

"Trump, Covid and a lasting national trauma- What Nightmare Scenario Says","As the world wakes from its pandemic-induced coma, Bloomberg rates the US as the best place to be. More than 150 million Americans have been vaccinated; little more than 4,100 have been hospitalized or have died as a result of breakthrough infection.

The vaccines worked – but too late to save more than 600,000 Americans who have died. More than 500,000 were on Donald Trump’s watch.
Alex Azar, the secretary of health and human services, laboured in constant fear of Trump and competitors inside the government. After taking a hard line against flavoured e-cigarettes early on, to Trump’s dismay, Azar never recovered. The pandemic simply deepened his personal nightmare.

When Covid struck, he was all but a dead man walking. Then the White House Covid taskforce, headed by Mike Pence, neutered his authority. Think of it as a one-two punch. True to form, Trump told a taskforce member Azar was “in trouble” and that he, Trump, had “saved him”.

The Goldilocks Supernova,"A worldwide team led by UC Santa Barbara scientists at Las Cumbres Observatory has discovered the first convincing evidence for a new type of stellar explosion -- an electron-capture supernova. While they have been theorized for 40 years, real-world examples have been elusive. They are thought to arise from the explosions of massive super-asymptotic giant branch (SAGB) stars, for which there has also been scant evidence. The discovery, published in Nature Astronomy, also sheds new light on the thousand-year mystery of the supernova from A.D. 1054 that was visible all over the world in the daytime, before eventually becoming the Crab Nebula.

Historically, supernovae have fallen into two main types: thermonuclear and iron-core collapse. A thermonuclear supernova is the explosion of a white dwarf star after it gains matter in a binary star system. These white dwarfs are the dense cores of ash that remain after a low-mass star (one up to about 8 times the mass of the sun) reaches the end of its life. An iron core-collapse supernova occurs when a massive star -- one more than about 10 times the mass of the sun -- runs out of nuclear fuel and its iron core collapses, creating a black hole or neutron star. Between these two main types of supernovae are electron-capture supernovae. These stars stop fusion when their cores are made of oxygen, neon and magnesium; they aren't massive enough to create iron.

While gravity is always trying to crush a star, what keeps most stars from collapsing is either ongoing fusion or, in cores where fusion has stopped, the fact that you can't pack the atoms any tighter. In an electron capture supernova, some of the electrons in the oxygen-neon-magnesium core get smashed into their atomic nuclei in a process called electron capture.This removal of electrons causes the core of the star to buckle under its own weight and collapse, resulting in an electron-capture supernova.

Is stalemate at OPEC responsible for the rise in international oil prices?,"Oil prices are at their highest in years, and the demand for crude because of economies recovering from Covid-19 is not a reason for that. Crude has seen the best six months of the first half a year in over 10 years. With economies like the U.S., China, and Europe showing signs of recovery, there is great demand, but the reason for rising prices is uncertainty among the group of oil producers, Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC+).

Oil prices continued to climb after it came to light that OPEC+ is yet to finalize a two-million-barrel-per-day (BPD) output that was expected from August to stabilize the prices, but it couldn't come through after the United Arab Emirates (UAE) was non-committal. The UAE is one of the largest oil producers in the world. The decision to raise the output has been delayed with more negotiations in the offing.

With the crude prices hovering around USD 75 per barrel, the OPEC+ should decide if this price is good for everyone or a need to push up prices by keeping the supply at the current level.

Oil prices touched historic lows during the height of the pandemic last year, but they have now recovered to pre-pandemic levels. But new coronavirus variants have made the situation uncertain, with some fearing that if the variants spread, the oil demand could go down, pushing the prices further down.

 Moreover, it is said that some of the countries of the Middle East are still recovering from last year's oil slump in the market. They don't want to let go of an opportunity to sell oil at high prices.

Hgh testosterone levels: Namibian athletes ruled ineligible for Tokyo 2020,"Namibian sprinters Christine Mboma and Beatrice Masilingi have been ruled ineligible to compete in the women's 400m at the Tokyo Olympics due to naturally high testosterone levels, the Namibia National Olympic Committee and Commonwealth Games Association (NNOC-CGA) said in a statement Friday.

Mboma and Masilingi have turned in four of the top five 400m times in the world this year, according to the World Athletics website.

The elevated testosterone levels were detected during medical assessments required by World Athletics.

The global governing body requires that female athletes' blood testosterone levels be under 5 nmol/L (nanomoles per liter) to compete in select women's events, including the 400m.

The two 18-year-old athletes were ruled ineligible because of World Athletics' policy on Athletes with Differences of Sex Development (DSD).

World Athletics banned athletes who have elevated blood testosterone levels from competing in women's races from 400m to one mile in distance in international competition when it introduced new DSD regulations in 2018.

In order to compete, those athletes must lower their testosterone levels with medication, which World Athletics says ensures fair competition, reported CNN",tokyo
Tourism: Vaccine inequality may cause trillion-dollar losses to poorer countries,"Tourism is a lifeline for millions of people, especially in poorer countries of the world and the Covid pandemic had a devastating impact on the people who depended on tourism. As Europe opens its doors to tourism after vaccinating much of its adult population, many countries cannot throw open their doors because of low vaccination numbers.

A report jointly presented with the UN World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) says that international tourism suffered an estimated loss of $2.4 trillion in 2020 due to the direct and indirect impact of lack of international tourist arrivals. These could continue in many countries even in 2021.

The report is unequivocal in stating that this is happening because of inequity in vaccine roll-out at the world level. The fact is that international tourism declined 74 percent between January and December 2020, and if the pre-Covid months of January and February 2020 are excluded, the fall in arrivals amounts to 84 percent. But this year it could be a bit different.

Countries with a high share of vaccinated people may have tourism recovering as it is being witnessed the EU countries as compared to many others in Asia and Africa where the vaccine coverage is very low.

The world's richest countries have to step in if the tourism has to pick in the low-income countries. If the low-income countries have better vaccination rates, it will restore travelers' confidence, who may be concerned about health.

The report says that the most affected regions will be North-East Asia, South-East Asia, Oceania, North Africa and South Asia. The least affected will be North America, Western Europe, and the Caribbean.

How important is football to you and your community?

Football gives me strength and confidence and fitness. It establishes a daily routine to my life.

Some people in the camp believe that football is only for boys, and girls shouldn’t do it. But when I play football it raises my spirits and it reinforces my self-confidence. 

Because I am a girl, I can be the person that changes how the community perceives girls’ football and breaks the wall of shame.

I am a player for FC Chernomorets Odessa women’s team in the first division of Ukraine.  Since childhood I loved football, I always played with the boys in the yard, though basically I stood at the gate. But after moving, life turned out differently and now I am a striker.

At 11, I moved to Odessa and for two years I did not realize that there was professional women's football in Ukraine. But in the 7th grade, at a physical education lesson, a girl noticed me during a game and suggested that I practice professionally.  After a while, I met my coach and started going to training.  After 2 months, I was part of the team that went to the Under-14 Ukrainian Championship. I scored my first goal and took the team to the final.  In this Championship, I was awarded the title of “Best Striker”.  This started my professional career in football. My goal is to get a contract with and play for a European or American team in the future.

Why is football important to you and your community?

Football is my passion. Each workout is important to me. I love to feel the power in myself and give it my all in every game. Football gave me a lot: friends, endurance, character and determination. This is something that I will never tire of doing. With the help of football, I maintain my physical and spiritual health.

When I first joined the team, I immediately started talking with the girls and we became very good friends. My team and I love to get together with other people from different schools, universities or even cities and compete with them.

Why is China so interested in Falkland islands?,"While China has little economic interest in or connection to the Falkland Islands, and has repeatedly rejected criticisms of its policies in Hong Kong and Xinjiang as meddling in its internal affairs, it recently spoke out at the United Nations, criticising Western colonialism and renewing its support for Argentina. Why Argentina? Because e Argentina has continued to claim sovereignty over the Falkland Islands – which it calls Las Malvinas – despite islanders voting in a 2013 referendum to remain a UK overseas territory. And like Hong Kong, it has a colonial past under British rule.

This shows that Beijing wants to challenge what it sees as a Western-led global governance and question that through a closer look at historical incidents. But is this consistent with Beijing's principle of not interfering in other countries affairs?

China’s backing of Argentina over the Falkland Islands at the UN is not new but is particularly relevant to the current geopolitical atmosphere. In 1982 Deng Xiaoping and Margaret Thatcher began talks on the handover arrangements for Hong Kong. Britain had just won a war against Argentina, which had invaded and occupied the islands. Thatcher was said to have come to the talks with “pride from winning the war with Argentina” and was faced with Deng who’d famously just told his staff that “China is not like Argentina, and Hong Kong is not like the Malvinas”.

So what is Beijing's point now? It may be couched in anti-colonialism terms but is an attempt to undermine British criticisms of Beijing’s recent behaviour in Hong Kong.","china, uk, falkland"

‘Megadrought’ along border strains US-Mexico water relations,"Mumme, Colorado State University

The United States and Mexico are tussling over their dwindling shared water supplies after years of unprecedented heat and insufficient rainfall.

Sustained drought on the middle-lower Rio Grande since the mid-1990s means less Mexican water flows to the U.S. The Colorado River Basin, which supplies seven U.S. states and two Mexican states, is also at record low levels.

A 1944 treaty between the U.S. and Mexico governs water relations between the two neighbors. The International Boundary and Water Commission it established to manage the 450,000-square-mile Colorado and Rio Grande basins has done so adroitly, according to our research.

That able management kept U.S.-Mexico water relations mostly conflict-free. But it masked some well-known underlying stresses: a population boom on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border, climate change and aging waterworks.

1944 to 2021

The mostly semiarid U.S.-Mexico border region receives less than 18 inches of annual rainfall, with large areas getting under 12 inches. That’s less than half the average annual rainfall in the U.S., which is mainly temperate.

The 1940s, however, were a time of unusual water abundance on the treaty rivers. When American and Mexican engineers drafted the 1944 water treaty, they did not foresee today’s prolonged megadrought.

Nor did they anticipate the region’s rapid growth. Since 1940 the population of the 10 largest pairs of cities that straddle the U.S.-Mexico border has mushroomed nearly twentyfold, from 560,000 people to some 10 million today.

This growth is powered by a booming, water-dependent manufacturing industry in Mexico that exports products to U.S. markets. Irrigated agriculture, ranching and mining compete with growing cities and expanding industry for scarce water.

Today, there’s simply not enough of it to meet demand in the border areas governed by the 1944 treaty.

Three times since 1992 Mexico has fallen short of its five-year commitment to send 1.75 million acre-feet of water across the border to the U.S. Each acre-foot can supply a U.S. family of four for one year.

Water conflicts

In the fall of 2020, crisis erupted in the Rio Grande Valley after years of rising tensions and sustained drought that endanger crops and livestock in both the U.S. and Mexico.

Old image shared as recent action by Chandigarh police against farmers,"By Kalim Ahmed

A photograph of a group of police constables forcefully evicting a senior citizen has been shared with the claim that this is from the farmers’ protest in Chandigarh. Several users on social media have shared the image, condemning the police for their actions.

( Link https://twitter.com/harjind66859698/status/1409856198560546818?s=19)

The photo was shared by Twitter @SranHarjap, @Jass71093752, and @ChdVarinder, among others. It is also viral with the hashtag चंडीगढ़_पुलिस_किसान_विरोधी (Chandigarh police is anti-farmers).

The image is circulating against the backdrop of farmers’ protests across Chandigarh. The Times of India had reported that farm organisation BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) held protests against the state and central governments at deputy commissioner offices across Punjab on July 2. Farmers were protesting against erratic power supply for the farm sector and continuously rising prices of petroleum products. BKU held another protest today “outside the mini-secretariat at the district headquarters and at Dagru seeking rollback of the three farm laws and “false” cases by the Chandigarh police against farmers”, as per The Tribune.

A reverse image search on Google took us to a news report by Hindustan Times which said that the photograph was taken in 2015 in the Hariaua village near Patiala. A group of farmers were protesting against the district administration’s move to take control over the panchayat land, which was “illegally” occupied by some tenants.

The police and administration teams had court orders to take possession of the land, but unhappy farmers started pelting stones and the police retaliated with force to tackle the situation. The police lathi-charged and fired tear shells on the protestors. The local farmers’ leader said that they had a stay order on vacating the land but police were not ready to listen. As a result of the clash, twelve farmers and three cops were injured.

The Tribune similarly wrote that a violent clash took place between police and protesters who had opposed police action to vacate panchayat land at Hariau Kalan village in Patran.

15. Dial D for Don: Gifts from the Gulf- Getting Aftab back to Delhi,"“Gifts from the Gulf” continues…

It was then that the Ambassador informed me that Aftab Ansari a.k.a. Farhan Malik had been arrested at the Dubai International Airport on Feb. 23, 2002, the day after the Kolkata attack. He was attempting to leave for Islamabad by an Emirates flight and was travelling on a Pakistani Passport J 872142, in the name of Safeer Mahmood Rana issued at Lahore. The details of the passport were the same as had been shared by me with Ambassador Singh and Ambassador Blackwill. We would never know how much the Americans contributed in getting Dubai to locate and arrest Aftab but my own sense is that involving the Americans, in all probability, did help in getting Dubai to react fast. The news of Aftab’s arrest was kept close to their chest by the Dubai authorities between Feb 23 – the date of his interception and my anxious wait continued for the remaining part of February 6 & 7 during which I was deluged with phone calls from Delhi.

 My bosses wanted to know the progress almost every half an hour as the Government of India was getting impatient. Finally, on February 8, I was given the good news by our Ambassador that I could take Aftab Ansari back to India as his deportation had been cleared by the Dubai government. I conveyed the decision to my Director with the request that a government aircraft be sent to bring the captive back to Delhi.

Why Britons with Indian-made Covid vaccine may face travel issues,"A Briton going to any EU country with a Covid vaccine certificate with the 4120Z001, 4120Z002 or 4120Z003 could be denied entry. The Serum Institute of India (SII) made the vaccines with these batch numbers in India.

As they are manufactured in India, the EU's drug regulator, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) does not recognize them. , People administered with the vaccine may face hurdles traveling to the bloc countries. 

The UK has administered the SII-manufactured vaccine to around 5 million Britons. It is called Covishield in India and it is derived from AstraZeneca's Vaxzevria.

The UK government has said that it will work with the European Commission and resolve it soon. It has said that all AstraZeneca vaccines used in the UK are the ""same product and subject to regular checks"". [https://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-britons-reassured-over-fears-those-who-received-india-made-covishield-jabs-cant-travel-to-eu-12347013]

Professor Adam Finn, a member of the UK's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) of the British government, has told the media that it was a ""bureaucratic issue"" and that the India-manufactured jab was as able the ones manufactured in Europe. [https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/astrazeneca-vaccine-india-travel-ban-eu-adam-finn-b943811.html]

Interestingly Indian government is also in talks with the EU and other governments to recognize the SII vaccine. It has come to light that SII didn't apply to have the vaccine approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA).  SII has argued that since it manufactured vaccines were going to be part of the United Nation's GAVI vaccination program for low-income countries, it didn't apply for a license.

But with Britons facing hurdles, the UK government could take the lead in getting the Indian-made vaccine recognized.

"No, a Shivaling wasn’t revealed in ‘Mecca Madina’","By Kalim Ahmed

Two images are circulating on social media with the claim that for the first time in history the Shivaling was revealed in Mecca-Madina. The claim requests Hindus to share the images.

[Original text in Hindi: इतिहास में पहली बार मक्का मदीना का शिवलिंग दिखाया गया हे सभी हिन्दू भाई चुके नही शेयर जरूर करे]

The first image has recently been shared on Facebook while the second image has been on the platform at least since 2017.

The claim is viral on both Twitter and Facebook. Alt News has also received several requests to verify the claim on its official WhatsApp helpline number (+91 76000 11160).

Fact-check

Image 1

For the first image, we performed a reverse image search on Yandex which took us to a page on Pinterest that describes the image as “Rukn E Yamani corner of Kaaba”. The image carries the name of the Facebook page ‘Cities of muhammad (pbuh)’ on top. A rummage through the page took us to the original photo published in 2012.

( Link https://www.facebook.com/CitiesOfMuhammad.pbuh/photos/a.219795448150076/219799044816383/?type=3)

We found a reference to the Rukn-e-Yamani on the Government of India’s Haj guide PDF (page 41) prepared by the Haj Committee of India, a statutory body of the Ministry of Minority Affairs. It says that the Kaaba in Mecca has four corners 1) Hajr-e-Aswad, 2) Rukn-e-Shami, 3) Rukn-e-Iraqi and 4) Rukn-e-Yamani.

Rukn-e-Yamani translates to “The Yemeni Corner” and is situated on the southwestern corner of the Kaaba. It faces Yemen thus the name Rukn-e-Yamani. Pilgrims perform “Istilaam” on the exposed corner i.e., they kiss or touch the corner and make a prayer.

Furthermore, Rukn-e-Shaam is the “The Syrian Corner”, Rukn-e-Iraqi is “The corner that faces Iraq” and Hajr-e-Aswad or “Black Stone” is on the eastern corner of the Kaaba.

Second image

For the second viral image, we again performed a reverse image search which took us to a page on Pinterest that identifies the idol as “12 Heads Shivalinga, Veeratpur, Rajasthan, India”.

CCTV video from Sri Lanka falsely viral as Muslim man attacks Hindu in India,"By Alt News Desk

“This is how Hindus are killed and their deaths are made to look like an accident,” is a message shared with a CCTV video of a man in a skull cap beating another man with a rod.

( Link https://fb.watch/6w60C04Fug/)

It is quite widely circulating on Facebook. Alt News has also received verification requests on its WhatsApp helpline number +91 76000 11160.

The same clip was circulating earlier in February.

( Link https://twitter.com/UmaShankar2054/status/1378996055555985416?s=19)

It was also shared with a differently-worded message – “We lack killer instinct, including me. We worry abt the consequences later. They are like “Jo hoga dekha jayega”. @narendramodi this is increasing their power! Please take some strict action (sic),” wrote Twitter user @TheMehtaji while another suggested that the Muslim community in India should be economically boycotted.

BJP Delhi social media head Naveen Kumar also shared the video. He wrote, “कपड़ों से पहचाना जा सकता है” referring to Prime Minister Modi’s statement during anti-CAA protests that those inciting violence “can be identified by their clothes”. His tweet was quote-tweeted by @seriousfunnyguy who is followed by PM Modi and BJP leaders Piyush Goyal, Smriti Irani and Kapil Mishra.

( Link https://twitter.com/naveenjindalbjp/status/1365256953577013249?s=19)

BJP supporter Sonam Mahajan tweeted, “Miyan bhai ki darin in true sense.” Several people in her comments believe that a Hindu man was attacked in India.

Another user @thakkar_sameet who is followed by PM Modi also shared the clip. It has also been circulated with Tamil captions.

Video from Sri Lanka

In the background, people can be heard talking in Sinhalese. This was the first clue that suggested the video could be from Sri Lanka.

Fact Crescendo Sri Lanka contacted Galaha police station in the central province of Sri Lanka. Acting OIC Rodrigo told the outlet that the attack was not religiously motivated. “The Muslim person is mentally ill. He suddenly engaged in the attack. We arrested him immediately and kept him in police custody. At present, the injured person is being treated at the hospital,” he said.

Take this kiss upon the brow,"Take this kiss upon the brow!
And, in parting from you now,
Thus much let me avow —
You are not wrong, who deem
That my days have been a dream;
Yet if hope has flown away
In a night, or in a day,
In a vision, or in none,
Is it therefore the less gone? 
All that we see or seem
Is but a dream within a dream.

I stand amid the roar
Of a surf-tormented shore,
And I hold within my hand
Grains of the golden sand —
How few! yet how they creep
Through my fingers to the deep,
While I weep — while I weep!
O God! Can I not grasp
Them with a tighter clasp?
O God! can I not save
One from the pitiless wave?
Is all that we see or seem
But a dream within a dream?

Communist Party of China @ 100: Why next hundred years are not going to be smooth,"As China’s Communist Party (CPC) celebrates its centenary, its history is the overarching theme – and so is its future. “We must march forward towards the second centenary goal,” Xi said at a ceremonial event. [https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/chinese-communist-party-needs-new-heroes-in-second-century-xi] 

From its humble beginnings, the CPC has come a long way. Over the hundred years, its model of thorough ideological flexibility backed by authoritarianism has withstood challenges like the internet. In the absence of democracy, it has practically no challenge to its hold on power. Still, taking no chances, it has refined thought control to the extent that a citizen says nobody can imagine it losing power for at least fifty years. 

But the past performance is no guarantee of the future. Among the potential challenges ahead are:

* Keeping up the pace: The cornerstone of the party’s power is economic growth – some fifty times since Mao’s death, and ten years shy of overtaking the US. Trouble is, the low-hanging fruits are gone, the ageing workforce is shrinking, and reforms are necessary but they can impact the interests of key power centers. 

* Cooperation: The CPC’s model of power makes it a loner on the world stage. It stands apart – as it did after the virus outbreak and as it continues to do in global climate action targets. A superpower’s influence is measured by its leadership on humanity’s common goals. The Party will have to learn to give up extending its domestic power tactics onto its global interventions. 

* Image: On the world stage, the CPC and China are known for strong-arm tactics. Of late, party bosses have spoken of the need to go beyond this ‘wolf-warrior’ diplomacy and also aim to acquire soft power. But in the centenary celebrations Thursday, Xi reverted to the theme when he warned the enemies they’d have “heads bashed bloody”. Its unalloyed aggression will take it only up to a point – and not beyond, if it wants to influence the course of world events. It’s emerging as superpower in the shape of a bully and not a big daddy.

Ferrari 296 GTB. it's an 830hp hybrid🤩🤩🚗🚗🏎️🏎️🏎️🏎️,"Don't forget to check the slides....

Watch it in video here -https://youtu.be/hsWuH3zDzNE

The Ferrari 296 GTB, the latest evolution of Maranello's mid-rear-engined two-seater berlinetta, was premiered during an online event broadcast on Ferrari's social media and web channels. The 296 GTB redefines the whole concept of fun behind the wheel, guaranteeing pure emotions not just when pushing the car to its limits, but also in day-to-day driving situations.

The 296 GTB ushers in an authentic revolution for Ferrari as it introduces a new engine type to flank the marque's multi-award-winning 8- and 12-cylinder power units: a new 663 cv 120° V6 coupled with an electric motor capable of delivering a further 122 kW (167 cv). This is the first 6-cylinder engine installed on a road car sporting the Prancing Horse badge; it unleashes its massive 830 cv total power output to deliver previously unthinkable performance levels and an innovative, exhilarating and unique soundtrack.

The car's name, which combines its total displacement (2992 l) and number of cylinders was chosen, with the addition of the GTB (Gran Turismo Berlinetta) acronym in finest Ferrari tradition, to underscore this new engine's epoch-changing importance to Maranello. It is not simply the living, beating heart of the Ferrari 296 GTB, but it also ushers in a new V6 era that has its roots deep in Ferrari's unparalleled 70-year-plus experience in motor sports.

The very first Ferrari V6, in fact, featured a 65° architecture and debuted on the 1957 1500 cc Dino 156 F2 single-seater. This was followed in 1958 by bigger displacement versions on the front-engined sport prototypes - the 196 S and 296 S - and F1 cars, such as the 246 F1 which powered Mike Hawthorn to the F1 Drivers' Championship title the same year.","automobiles, bike, cars, hypercars, car, supercar"
"US exits last Afghan base, but is war really over?","As troops left the last US military base, Bagram Air Base, and the Afghan government took charge of it, the nearly two-decade-long Afghan war has ‘symbolically’ come to its end. But is it really over? There’s a protracted endgame going on, along with an element of uncertainty about the Taliban response to it.

The exit on Thursday-Friday was not marked by any ceremonial or formal farewell; no treaty, no surrender, no formal gesture of a closure – as has been the case with all major wars. (There was a ceremony when US troops withdrew from Iraq in 2011.)

President Joe Biden in his announcement earlier had given the Pentagon time until Sept. 11, the twentieth anniversary of the terrorist attacks, to wrap up the withdrawal. After the Bagram Air Base transfer, the Pentagon promised to complete the pullout by the end of August. The army general in charge in Kabul, Scott Miller, has nearly completed the process, and almost all troops and equipment have gone. Miller is expected to remain in command for a fortnight or so. Will that be the formal end point? No.

There will still be a part of the endgame left after that. At least until September the head of US Central Command, Gen. Frank McKenzie, will still have the authority to defend Afghan forces against the Taliban. He can order strikes with US fighter aircraft based outside the country.

Also, 650 troops – an unusually large contingent – will remain stationed in the US Embassy compound to protect American diplomats and possibly to help local forced secure the Kabul airport.

Just as there’s no clarity about the end point of this major war of our times, its outcome is rqually hazy. Did any side win it now that it has ended ‘symbolically’? The Taliban are back and the situation in Afghanistan is threatening to resemble the situation two decades ago. The only accomplishment, as President Biden admits, is that the US forces succeeded in dismantling Al Qaida and killing Osama bin Laden, its leader and alleged mastermind of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

"Fountain springs water upon chanting ‘Om’? No, it is voice-activated","By Pooja Chaudhuri

A video currently viral on social media is being circulated with the claim that it depicts a fountain in Thailand which magically springs water when somebody chants the Hindu mantra ‘ॐ’ (Om). One Ganesh Divadiga shared the video on Facebook groups Bhagavad Gita and Hinduism Worldwide.

Divadiga has posted BJP leader Ram Kadam’s post from last year. Kadam has shared the video with the same claim, drawing over 2 lakh likes and 72,000 shares.

In the clip, a woman can be heard screaming into a mic and water shoots up from the valley in front of her. The video was also viral last year.

( Link https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=713451975777528&id=100013381953270)

The caption used to share the video said – “थाइलैंड में एक पर्वत के नीचे पानी का एक छोटा जरंना (small natural river) के बाजु वाले पर्वत पे *ओम् (ॐ)* का उच्चारण करते पानी फ़ूवाँरा बन कर पर्वत से भी अपर तक उछलता है….ये किसी साधु सम्प्रदाय ने बनाया है…. हमें ये नहि समज में आता है की ये एैसे कैसे होता है ? पानी का वज़न + गुरुत्वाकर्षण से भी इतना अपर पानी सिर्फ़ आवाज़ के तरंग से कैसे जा सकता है? ये कोई विज्ञानी ही बता सकता है…. उसे जान ने के लिए हमें बहुत जिज्ञासा है क्योंकि ऐसा सिर्फ़ *ओम् (ॐ)* बोल ने पर ही होता हे !! ये भी एक अजीबो अजूबा है. A stream flows below a mountain in Thailand. If you pronounce ‘Om’ at the adjacent mountain, the water shoots up even higher than the height of the mountain itself. A community of saints has built this fountain. We don’t understand how this happens. How can the water defy its own weight and gravity and reach such heights just because of someone’s voice? Only a theologist can explain this. We are curious to know how this happens because it’s possible only when you say ‘Om’. It’s a miracle.”

"Final covaxin data released, will the world recognise it now","Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech India Ltd (BBIL) on July 3 publicised the long-awaited results of the Phase-3 trial of Covaxin that involved nearly 25,800 volunteers spanning 25 hospitals across the country. The vaccine is said to have 77.8 percent efficacy against symptomatic Covid. 
The good news however is it has shown around 65 percent efficacy around the more virulent Delta variant, which was responsible for causing the devastating second wave of Covid 19 in india . 

According to reports India is now likely to push for Covaxin recognition by WHO and EU. As the indigenous Indian vaccine is yet to get recognition a majority of people who have got the covaxin shot ( like me and many of my friends) are not eligible to enter certain countries and undertake international travel. 
According to a peer review study which was published in lancet, AstraZeneca however has only 70 percent efficacy . 
The covaxin study however is not peer reviewed and published yet. 

Bharat Biotech has also applied to the World Health Organisation, for which the submission of Phase-3 data is a necessary requirement, for a chance at obtaining an Emergency Use Licence that would aid in getting the vaccine approved in more countries. So far, less than 4 crore doses of Covaxin have been administered to Indians since January. The company has claimed it can produce over six crore doses per month and scale up to 10 crore by September.

Covaxin has now received emergency use authorisation in 16 countries, including Brazil, India, Philippines, Iran, Mexico, and is in process in 50 countries worldwide.

WHO has recognised several vaccines from the makers like Oxford AstraZeneca, Pfizer and Moderna which enables the vaccine makers to export the doses worldwide.

Bharat Biotech has signed agreements with pharmaceutical companies from Brazil and the U.S. where the vaccine will be either co-produced or exported but the absence of endorsement from WHO and other multilateral bodies is creating difficulties for the vaccine.

"Slower, Smarter, Older!","The story of *SOS* .

An Airbus 380 is on it's way across the Atlantic. It flies consistently at 800 km/h at 30,000 feet, when suddenly a Eurofighter with Tempo Mach 2 appears.

The young pilot of the fighter jet slows down, flies alongside the Airbus & greets the pilot of the passenger plane by radio:

 ""Airbus, boring flight isn’t it?
Now have a look here ! He rolls his jet on its back, accelerates, breaks through the sound barrier, rises rapidly to a dizzying height, then swoops down almost to sea level in a breathtaking dive. 

He loops back next to the Airbus and asks, ""Well, how was that?""

The Airbus pilot answers: ""Very impressive, but now you look !""
The jet pilot watches the Airbus, but nothing happens. It continues to fly stubbornly straight, with the same speed.

After 15 minutes, the Airbus pilot radios, ""Well, how was that?""
Confused, the jet pilot asks, ""What did you do?"" 

The AirBus pilot laughs and says, ""I got up, stretched my legs, walked back of the aircraft to use the bathroom, then got a cup of coffee, said hello with the pretty hostesses who handed me a chocolate fudge pastry.""

Congress seeks JPC probe into Rafale deal after France launches probe,"The Congress has demanded a joint parliamentary committee probe into the Rafale jet deal after the French Public Prosecution Services (PNF) ordered a probe into the agreement. 

""The scandalous expose of Rafale scam involving massive corruption, treason, loss to public exchequer has finally been uncovered and laid bare. The Congress party and Rahul Gandhi stand vindicated today,"" Congress' chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said. 
 
On June 14, he said PNF has ordered investigation into “Rafale Papers” for “corruption”, “influence peddling”, “money laundering”, “favouritism” on the complaint of French Anti-Corruption NGO, Sherpa. 

The investigation will cover among other elements, questions surrounding the actions of former French President François Hollande, who was in office when the Rafale deal was inked, and current French President Emmanuel Macron, who was at the time Hollande’s Economy and Finance Minister, as well as the then Defence Minister, now Foreign Affairs Minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian as also role of RInfra i.e. Reliance Infrastructure Limited.
 
The French News Website, Mediapart.fr, has also released details of the agreement inked between Reliance Infra and Dassault Aviation to constitute a Joint Venture Company called Dassault Reliance Aerospace Limited (DRAL), which substantiates the statement of  Hollande that decision to appoint Reliance as Dassault’s industrial partner was that of Modi government and that France “had no choice” in the matter, added Surjewala.
 
It is important to remember that the ‘Defence Procurement Procedure’ contains mandatory ‘anti-corruption clauses’ such as “No Bribery, No Gift, No Influence, No Commission, No Middlemen”. This mandatory policy was also part of the tender issued by Congress-UPA for purchase of 126 fighter aircraft. 
 
The Defence Ministry had proposed the mandatory ‘anti-corruption clauses’ to be part of the ‘Inter-Governmental Agreement’ on 20.07.2015 for the 36 aircraft Rafale deal by Modi government. 
 
The French government/Dassault deleted the ‘anti-corruption clauses’.

Bihar Floods:: Muzaffarpur villages flooded as swollen rivers inundate low-lying areas,"After rendering thousands of people homeless due to floods in twin districts of East and West Champaran, swollen rivers of Gandak, Burhi Gandak and Bagmati are now posing serious threat of inundating a vast stretch of land in Muzaffarpur district, officials said on Friday.

Muzaffarpur faced flood fury due to draining of the three rivers—Gandak, Burhi Gandak and Bagmati—in western, central and eastern parts of the district, director of Central Water Commission (CWC) Sharad Chandra said.
Officials said hundreds of villages of four blocks of the districts have been hit by floods. Thousands of people, along with their cattle, have been forced to take temporary shelters on highways, as their homes got submerged under floodwaters from the three rivers.
Heavy downpour in the catchment areas of different rivers in Nepal and in Bihar in the past 24 hours had led to considerable rise in water levels at different sections of their course. 

Many rivers originating from Himalayan regions, including Gandak, Lal Bakeya, Kamla, Adhwara and Khiroi, have jumped the danger levels (DL) and are exerting tremendous pressure on their embankments.

The Artist Story | Liu Jianbin,"Liu Jianbin is an ink artist and an art educator from China. He is also a member of the China Artists Association with decades of experience.

Liu's distinct individual style makes him stand out among contemporary Chinese ink artists. While inheriting the figurative style and realistic meticulous art skills from the academy, he has uniquely developed his artistic language which is a kind of subtle and indistinct manner.

In terms of modeling, in order to strengthen the characters and themes of the figures in his works, he deforms and exaggerates some body parts in order to express the different personalities and temperaments. Moreover, adding some elements borrowed from folk art makes the style of his works more hyperbolic and unique.

In recent years, the main theme of Liu Jianbin's works has been shifted from figures to landscapes, especially ancient dwellings. Water, ink, and colour crash and blend on his rice paper; houses, rooves, walls, and threes contrast and celebrate each other's beauty. In a refined style, Liu Jianbin's works reflect the rusticity and quietness of traditional Chinese villages, records the laborious work of local fishermen, or merely captures a life moment that seems to be very ordinary but touches the bottom of hearts. Through his precious painting, Liu happily depicts the Chinese lifestyles and praises the diligence, courage, and passion of the life of Chinese people. He insists on the innovation of the subject matter and content of his works. Although his recent oeuvres are mostly based on daily life, they show the lifestyle and philosophy that only belong to Chinese people. He also hopes to record the ephemeral homes and traditions in his works.","art, artist, arts therapy, arts, art museum, art galleries, art collector, artists, artists on pixstory, artist art, gallery"
Lalu Prasad : Nitish became CM by ‘passing exam in 3rd division’,"Patna : Taking a jibe at Nitish Kumar, RJD chief Lalu Prasad said the JD-U leader “passed examination with a third division” and went on to become the chief minister of Bihar. The remark was a reference to the seats won by the Janata Dal-United (JD-U) in the 2020 Bihar Assembly election.

Nitish Kumar-led JD-U managed to bag only 40 seats in the last year’s Assembly election, and finished with a third position. The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) got 75 seats while the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) secured 74 seats.

“Nitish became chief minister of Bihar after putting morality and mandate aside… its result is now coming in the form of their own legislators and ministers levelling corruption charges on the government,” Lalu Prasad said in a tweet.

Lalu’s statement has come at a time when Nitish Kumar is facing criticism that officialdom is ruling in the government and public representatives are ignored.

He was referring to Madan Sahani, the social welfare minister in the Nitish Kumar-led government, who offered to resign from the post, and also levelled serious allegations on his department’s principal secretary Atul Prasad.

“He somehow won the election with the third division after using bureaucracy and money power. There is not a question of good and bad government. I believe that there is no government in Bihar,” Lalu Prasad tweeted while sharing the video statement of Madan Sahani.

Sahani has levelled serious allegations on Atul Prasad, the principal secretary of the social welfare department. He said that the top bureaucrat is ignoring his suggestion to run the department.

The dispute between Sahani and Prasad happened during transfer posting of CDPOs and other officials of the department.

Sahani wanted transfer-posting of officials according to his choice. As per the norms, reshuffle of officers can be possible only after an officer has completed 3 years or more at one place. Sahani wanted to transfer all officials including those who have not completed three year’s tenure. His recommendations were refused by Prasad. This was the actual reason for the dispute between him and Prasad, resulting in few transfer-postings in June.","nitish kumar, lalu prasad yadav"
Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams : Fake news by select media houses confusing devotees,"Tirupati : The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD), custodian of the globally renowned Lord Venkateswara temple, on Saturday condemned a section of media houses for publishing fake news of the temple body and creating confusion among devotees.

“A section of media tried to create confusion among devotees,” said a TTD official and termed those media reports as void of facts.

He clarified and asserted that TTD did not cease any free services in Tirumala and brought more details.

According to the temple body, there were 176 counters in Tirumala prior to March 2020, issuing laddus (consecrated sweet), darshan (visit) tokens, SSD counters, SED counters and Alipiri toll gate counter.

“Out of which 86 were operated by Trilok, 40 by various banks, 18 laddu sevaks, and 29 by FM agencies. While Trilok withdrew its services even before March 2020, other banks also gave up as it involved cash transactions. Similar was the case with laddu sevaks,” said the official.

However, currently, only two banks are running 16 counters, which are also putting pressure on TTD that they will withdraw.

“At this juncture, to give more transparent services to devotees, TTD has called for tenders which took place in a transparent manner,” he noted.

He said KVM Info from Bengaluru quoted the lowest bid at Rs 11,402 per shift per counter against the previous value of Rs 12,345, excluding GST in both cases.

Further, TTD has reduced the number of counters from 176 to 164 as per requirement and even introduced deploying personnel on rotation basis by alternating staff once every two months, aimed at avoiding scope for misappropriation.

On Friday, former chief minister and Telugu Desam Party (TDP) supremo Nara Chandrababu Naidu shared a Telugu daily’s report and alleged that the sacredness of TTD is being compromised by handing over charge of various works to private firms, sidelining those who used to offer free services earlier.

Five day monsoon session of Bihar Legislature to commence on July 26,"The Bihar cabinet on Friday recommended the five-day monsoon session of the state legislature starting July 26.
The session comes at a time when political atmosphere in the state is high and the opposition leaders are out to corner the government on a number of contentious issues, including alleged Covid mismanagement, burgeoning prices of essential commodities and, most importantly, the growing dissenting voices from within the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA).

In another important measure to check illegal sand mining, the cabinet approved up to 25 times penalty on the vehicles caught carrying sand without appropriate and authentic documents. Officials said penalty for carrying illegally mined sand starts from ₹3,000. Those indulging in illegal mining activities might have to face two-year jail term if found guilty.
Officials said the mines department had to proposed hefty penalty as the government’s earning from the sand mining hardly went up despite substantial increase in the ghat (quarry) settlement charges.
These were among the 10 decisions that the state cabinet chaired by chief minister Nitish Kumar took in consultation with cabinet colleagues through a virtual meeting.
The issues affecting construction of much-awaited Ganga pathway are set to be settled after the cabinet cleared a proposal to hand over nearly 40 acres of land, located in Sabalpur area under Sonepur circle of Saran district. The construction of the bridge, parallel to Ashok Rajpath on the southern bed of Ganga, has been suffering delays for want of adequate allocation of land at various spots.

"Depression forces IIT-M student to commit suicide, teacher resigns over caste discrimination","Depression and homesickness are said to be the two major factors that apparently pushed a 22-year-old project assistant at IIT-Madras to commit suicide by self-immolation at the hockey ground on the institute campus on Thursday.

This surfaced after an 11-page suicide note was recovered from his rented house in Velechery in Chennai. 

Unnikrishnan Nair was a native of Ernakulam and after completing his master’s degree in his home town, he came to Chennai three months ago and joined IIT-Madras as a project assistant. He had moved into a three-bedroom apartment at Velachery, along with Anil from Kerala. 

In his purported suicide note, he had written that he felt lonely and was unable to cope up with work. 

The incident happen with days after an assistant professor of economics at IIT-Madras had resigned from his post alleging incidents of caste-based discrimination at the premier educational institution.

In his resignation letter, he had written that discrimination comes in several forms, from the people in position of power and irrespective of gender and their claimed political affiliations.


Professor Vipin P Veetil had claimed that here were multiple specific instances of discrimination and cautioned that he would be pursuing appropriate action to address it. 

ChintaBAR, an independent student group at the institute, meanwhile, reiterated its demand for setting up of SC/ST and OBC cells for grievance redressal, and that an inquiry be conducted into the matter raised by Veetil.

The resignation came days after the National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) had pulled up IIT-Madras for not hiring enough candidates to fill SC/ST/OBC vacancies for teaching positions.

According to a survey in 2019, IIT-Madras had topped the list with 14 suicides in the past ten years. 

In all, 52 incidents of suicides were reported across eight IITs from 2009 to 2019.

That year, four student suicides had committed suicide at IIT-Madras. 

Many students had attributed the high number of suicides at IITs to the toxic environment at these institutions, high expectations, solitude, cutthroat competition, apathy, and peer pressure, apart from general discrimination, including caste, religion and rural/urban divide. 

All these had caused major mental health issues among the students and prompted demands for taking measures to address these.","depression, mental stress, caste discrimination"
Tibetan student group ties up with Myanmar democracy movement,"Kolkata : Students For Free Tibet (SFT), a leading hardline Tibetan group, has tied up to pro-democracy groups in Myanmar, extending their anti-China campaign to new areas in Asia.

SFT’s Campaign Director Pema Doma told IANS they have linked up up the Burmese democracy movement because China’s repression in Tibet and its firm backing of the oppressive Myanmar military junta are but “two sides of the same coin”.

“In June, we saw an unprecedented collaboration between pro-democracy groups across Asia. SFT worked to further develop our key alliances with pro-democracy and human rights groups in Myanmar, Thailand, and other Milk Tea Alliance countries. We organised and participated in virtual and in-person events which have furthered democracy and self-determination in Asia,” Doma added.

Doma said Tibetan activists will henceforth strongly support the Burmese pro-democracy movement and appeal worldwide to force the military junta to force an end to the massacre of innocent civilians.

She said SFT staff also spoke at the Hong Kong movement’s 6/12 rally to commemorate the second anniversary of the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong, a Milk Tea alliance rally in Washington D.C., and a Thai rally in Washington Square Park.

Later in the month, Doma spoke at RightsCon, joining fellow Tibet advocates from around the world to discuss the intersection of technology and the Tibetan Resistance.

Wrapping up the month on June 23, International Olympics Day, SFT took a lead role in organising the Global Day of Action against the 2022 Beijing Olympics, with 50+ protests and actions in more than 25 countries around the world, she said.

Mayawati slams Akhilesh over his ‘preference’ for smaller parties,"Lucknow, July 2 : Bahujan Samaj Party President Mayawati, on Friday slammed Samajwadi Party saying that the party’s working style and anti-Dalit ideology had forced it to ally with smaller parties in Uttar Pradesh.

Mayawati’s series of tweets comes a day after Akhilesh Yadav indicated that the Samajwadi Party would tie-up with smaller political parties in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections.

Mayawati described the Samajwadi Party as ‘helpless,’ and said that its anti-Dalit approach had made all major parties stay away from it.

‘The Samajwadi Party is left with no option but to go with smaller parties and this reflects its helplessness now,” she said.

Mayawati has been rather vocal in attacking the Samajwadi Party after its rebel legislators started hobnobbing with SP president.

Akhilesh Yadav, meanwhile, has so far abstained from directly attacking the BSP and its president.

Vaccination rate in India declining,"                        It was on June 21 that India made a global record with highest single-day vaccinations as it administered over 86 lakh anti-coronavirus jabs in a day. A little over a week later, the vaccination rate of the country has dropped by 68 percent with India administering just 27.6 lakh jabs on 28th June, as per the Union Health Ministry data.
Further, on June 27, the number was lowest in the last 15 days when only 17.21 lakh doses were given – a drop of 80 percent from June 21 numbers, as per the Ministry data. India’s Covid-19 vaccination coverage on Thursday morning stood at 33.57 crore, the Union Health Ministry said.
New centralised free vaccination policy against coronavirus in India started from June 21. Under this, all above 18 years of age are being provided free jabs. The Union government is now procuring 75 percent of vaccines and giving them to states for free distribution. The Centre took the charge as the previous policy of letting states buy a portion of their requirements directly from companies was drastically impacting the vaccination drive.","covid 19, india, vacvination"

In the hope of getting justice for Bruno,"Yesterday I posted about Delhi High Court 's judgement about feeding stray dogs where they clearly mentioned not to harass or do something wrong with dogs. But there was news similar to this kind of running. I came across news of a dog named Bruno who was beaten up by three young men. This brutal act came into light when someone posted this video. The instant reaction one can have after watching this video is pathetic for those men. Showing themselves as men. Or to prove their masculinity they beat up someone who can't speak to them. Since the pet is a loved one he must have not seen such human reactions. Since he couldn't do anything against those men, they did this bad to them. 

Such brutal acts in our society make humans feel unfortunate for themselves. Especially just to be in the limelight or to prove someone, if you do anything wrong, you are leading a miserable life. That's what I feel. This means humanity needs to grow a lot. 

However, when this news went to the court, the judges decided to initiate animal rights PIL and named it after ""Bruno"". The animal rights are equal to human rights. Because even animals have emotions. They are also someone 's beloved. People are keep pets to spend time with them. The reason could be humans own action. Therefore such reactions to animals without any reason or revenge is against humanity. All the street animals or pets should be taken care as part of our own system not as aliens or less powerful.

Benjamin Franklin’s fight against a deadly virus: Colonial America was divided,"Exactly 300 years ago, in 1721, Benjamin Franklin and his fellow American colonists faced a deadly smallpox outbreak. Their varying responses constitute an eerily prescient object lesson for today’s world, similarly devastated by a virus and divided over vaccination three centuries later.

As a microbiologist and a Franklin scholar, we see some parallels between then and now that could help governments, journalists and the rest of us cope with the coronavirus pandemic and future threats.

Smallpox strikes Boston

Smallpox was nothing new in 1721. Known to have affected people for at least 3,000 years, it ran rampant in Boston, eventually striking more than half the city’s population. The virus killed about 1 in 13 residents – but the death toll was probably more, since the lack of sophisticated epidemiology made it impossible to identify the cause of all deaths.

What was new, at least to Boston, was a simple procedure that could protect people from the disease. It was known as “variolation” or “inoculation,” and involved deliberately exposing someone to the smallpox “matter” from a victim’s scabs or pus, injecting the material into the skin using a needle. This approach typically caused a mild disease and induced a state of “immunity” against smallpox.

Even today, the exact mechanism is poorly understood and not much research on variolation has been done. Inoculation through the skin seems to activate an immune response that leads to milder symptoms and less transmission, possibly because of the route of infection and the lower dose. Since it relies on activating the immune response with live smallpox variola virus, inoculation is different from the modern vaccination that eradicated smallpox using the much less harmful but related vaccinia virus.

The inoculation treatment, which originated in Asia and Africa, came to be known in Boston thanks to a man named Onesimus. By 1721, Onesimus was enslaved, owned by the most influential man in all of Boston, the Rev. Cotton Mather.

12. khaki files – Devils’s Advocate : The story of the great & humble lawyer’s assassination,"Devil’s Advocate continues ………….

It had been barely a year since I had got to know this extraordinary lawyer. In that brief period of time, he had worked diligently for us, saved our prestige and procured a landmark judgment in our favour. All this he had achieved in the face of hostile public opinion. He had left an indelible impression on me with his legal acumen, humility and friendship. It was not easy to come to terms with what had just happened.

Days later, I learnt of the sequence of events that had led to the tragic killing of Gurcharan Singh. The advocate was representing the state against Brij Mohan Sharma, a notorious gangster who operated in Uttar Pradesh and Delhi, in a case of murder. Gurcharan Singh, as always, was brilliant in his arguments against the accused. 

Brij Mohan realized that if the lawyer continued with his prosecution, his conviction was certain. He shared his fears with his friend Manjeet Singh, another inveterate criminal from Agra. Together, after a court hearing, they threatened the lawyer with dire consequences if he did not give up the case. Gurcharan Singh told them, ‘If I were to back off from a case because of threats from goons like you, I better leave practising law.’ 

The goons then called up his wife and warned her that if her husband did not relent he would be done away with. When she brought the conversation to her husband’s attention, he brushed her off summarily. The accused, finding the lawyer unyielding, decided to silence him once and for all.

On that fateful evening, at about 8.45 p.m., Gurcharan Singh was at his residential office with his associate Krishna Tyagi. He was dictating a brief to his stenographer, J.S. Oberoi, for a client, who was also present. That was when he spotted a young boy peeping into his office through the glass door. He waved the boy in.

After protracted hearings the court pronounced its verdict. In its final order, the Delhi High Court, far from indicting us, appreciated the police action and observed that had it not been for the police firing, there would have been mayhem in INA market. It was a historic verdict in our favour. What began as an anti-police tirade ended up becoming a feather in our cap. Relief and joy were writ large on the faces of the south district police officers.

Gurcharan Singh drove down to my office soon after the verdict was delivered. I received him outside my office, hugged him and thanked him profusely for what he had achieved on our behalf. If not for his dedication, hard work and rare calibre, this day would have eluded us. The dignified lawyer was happy but humble as we lavished him with praise and appreciation for his unwavering support at a time when the rest of his brethren had deserted us. He said, ‘You people did your job well and I tried to do mine as well as I could.’

In the months that followed, as it usually happens, both of us became preoccupied with our respective worlds. Contact between us gradually diminished, until the phone by my bedside rang late one night.

On 6 June 1991, less than a year since we had first met, I was jolted awake by the shrill ringing of the telephone. A relative of Gurcharan Singh was on the line, and he said  he had bad news for me. His voice quivered as he spoke. He told me that earlier that evening my friend had been shot dead by three unknown assailants. I couldn’t believe what I heard. What, who, how, why were some of the questions I needed the answers to. The grief-stricken caller hung up. I was left in a state of shock by the suddenness of it all.

New York City or Los Angeles? Where you live says a lot about what and when you tweet,"The Big Apple versus The Big Orange. The City of Dreams versus The City of Angels. I’m referring, of course, to the ongoing rivalry between New York City and Los Angeles. Hilarious “survey” videos and talk shows will give you one picture of the cities. My colleagues and I decided to take a more serious look at the differences between the cities, so we studied what everyone else was talking about – on Twitter.

We set out to answer a simple research question: Are people who are located near each other likely to tweet about similar things? To do so, we analyzed millions of GPS-enabled tweets across New York City and LA. This type of study – looking at huge amounts of social media traffic by location – is useful for more than tracking pop culture memes in different cities. It could be valuable for understanding many aspects of urban life, including the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

If we were considering the case of a single, small community that takes pride in local events, celebrities and culture, the answer to our research question would be a resounding “yes.” One challenge in comparing two large, international cities is the reality that globalization has led to unprecedented interaction among multiple cultures and peoples, along with Starbucks and McDonald’s seemingly in every city on the planet.

For cities that are international but also take pride in their uniqueness, the key is teasing out the extent to which local qualities or global culture dominate tweeting behavior. We designed our methods to be precise enough to account for the fact that, contrary to the fun videos, New York City and LA are quite similar. Both have high housing costs, famous educational institutions, hospitals, museums and other cultural establishments, and residents who tend to vote Democratic.

Define ‘close’ and ‘same’

Our study tackled two problems: There’s no simple definition of “close together,” and it’s difficult to say whether two tweets are about the same topic. We combined several definitions of “close together,” ranging from people located in the same city to the distance in miles between their coordinates, using a common formula from spatial sciences.

How animals tacle with hot summer?,"I don't know what animals exactly do in summers, but yeah! I wanted to ask one thing that what we are doing to save them in this hot weather? Isn't it our moral duty that we need to help those who are needy? 
If yes, then what exactly we are supposed to do? I am discussing the same below;
1} Try to put pot filled with water in the corner of your roof, so that birds can get water when they see it, because in these hot weather they usually die without water.
2} For dog and migrated cows, we need to put bucket filled with water ☺️
3} If we have dog in our area and they usually gathering around your house, so we need to make a shade for them, so that they can hide themselves in winter, summer and rainy,

- I have this dog(in the picture) around my surrounding and I have seen him generally sitting in water pool in summers, but all animals generally don't have such comfort.
So, try to help them as they are also a life🤞🙏🙏🙏","animals, animal lover, animals and nature, animal, morality, animal welfare, duty"

Restraining academics doesn’t show a very confident China,"Rana Mitter hits the nail on the head: 

“China has been at great pains to showcase its new-found confidence in its model, and demands that the world take it seriously. There are good reasons to do so. But the people most able to have that discussion – the social scientists and humanists who understand the details and intricacies of China’s past and present – need to be able to engage in a complex discussion, not a propaganda stand-off.

Scholars who are able to denounce Trump and American hegemonism, but can barely utter a word in criticism of China’s diplomacy, will always have a hand tied behind their backs in discussions of international affairs. Historians who have important things to say about the economic miracle of China’s reforms since 1978 are operating at only half strength if they can’t also contrast it with the economic and human disaster of the Great Leap Forward of the 1950s.”

There is a salutary lesson for Delhi as well as the new regime tries to restrict academic exchanges with foreign countries and makes rules that require extensive permissions. It is a sign of weakness, not of strength and will not help build India’s case globally.",china
"Controversy over Communion in the Catholic Church goes back some 2,000 years","The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops recently approved drafting a document on receiving Communion in the Catholic Church. It will include a section regarding standards for politicians and public figures who support laws allowing abortion, euthanasia and other “moral evils.”

The proposed document has already caused controversy. The Vatican has warned against exclusively focusing on abortion and euthanasia and cautioned that the document could further divide U.S. Catholics.

As a Catholic scholar of religion, I would argue that battles over Communion are nothing new in the Catholic Church.

The importance of Communion

In the Catholic Church, the Communion service is one of seven rituals called sacraments that have a primary significance. During this service, called a Mass, Catholics believe that the bread and wine, when specially blessed by a priest, become the body and blood of Jesus Christ. Ritually consuming this bread and wine is a special way to “commune,” or be united, with Jesus Christ.
Catholics call both the celebration of Mass and the blessed bread and wine the Eucharist, from the Greek word meaning “thanksgiving.” Receiving Communion can also be called receiving the Eucharist.

The Catholic Church teaches that in order to receive Communion, a person must not be conscious of a serious sin – such as murder or adultery – that has not already been absolved through confession to a priest.

In early Christianity, rules about receiving Communion could be strict. Christians who were known to be guilty of serious sins were not supposed to receive Communion until they went through a process of reconciliation with a local bishop. In the Middle Ages, very few Catholics actually received Communion at all, as many believed that they were unworthy to do so.

The possibility of scandal

In the 19th and 20th centuries, the Catholic Church encouraged a more frequent – even daily – reception of Communion.

Still, one of the main concerns surrounding Communion is that someone publicly known to be committing serious sins would receive Communion. Such cases create “scandal.”

Then and now: Arctic sea-ice feeling the heat,"Arctic sea-ice plays an important role in controlling the planet's temperature, and any problem with this natural thermostat is a cause for concern.

Figures from the US space agency (Nasa) suggest the loss of the minimum Arctic sea-ice extent is in the region of 13.1% per decade, based on the 1981 to 2010 average.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report in 2007 concluded that the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere as a result of human activity was primarily responsible for the decline in sea-ice extent in the region.

The disappearance of the sea-ice in a warming world also contributes to rising average surface temperatures. The sea-ice is estimated to reflect 80% of sunlight back into space, meaning it does not warm the surface.

But when the sea-ice has melted, the darker ocean surface is exposed, which absorbs about 90% of the sunlight hitting it. This results in warming of the region.

This phenomenon is known as the Albedo effect, and it occurs because light surfaces reflect more heat then dark surfaces.

What do I think about the Norwegian law that requires labelling of edited photos?,"It’s ironic that I stumbled upon this piece of information on a German model’s story. I immediately wanted to fact check it. It’s progressive, it’s awesome, but is it really true? How are they going to check a tonne of pictures being posted on social media?

So, the law applies only to influencers and big companies, across all the social media giants - Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat and TikTok. Which means, commoners could basically get away with adding a filter or touching up here and there. That’s okay, if you consider the amount of followers influencers have, and the number of people who constantly get influenced by their “perfect bodies” and “flawless faces”. 

The law requires clarification of not only the digital manipulation on the photos, but also, physical alterations that may have been made, failing which could result you ending up in jail or being fined.

Honestly, I do follow pretty people on Instagram. Models, celebs, influencers. I do lead a fairly healthy lifestyle and don’t hate the way I look, but I won’t deny that I don’t stop at a photo once in a while and compare myself to it. Not everyone is as kind to themselves.

I came across a post which showed how Kim Kardashian had edited a video of her for a Skims campaign, and I was surprised, but was I really surprised?

You can blame the pandemic and the video calling culture as people now want surgeries as it’s affecting the way people look at themselves.

The law is something I’m one hundred percent rooting for. Something that should be imbibed in other countries as well. We need to be kinder to ourselves, in the way our bodies are shaped, and the way we look. Our bodies are working hard to help us navigate through this experience called life. 

Love it, let it live, and stop the comparison. I also hope that people who edit their pictures for whatever reasons, break through this compulsion of being perfect, and that we come together to know and understand that we’re all different and we’re all beautiful.","social media, body positivity, beauty standards"

Italy book tickets vs Spain for the semis,"The final score read 2-1 as Italy fans cheered their heroes in Allianz Arena. 
Lukaku's goal did provide the Belgians a sense of urgency and they came very close to scoring on two separate occasions. However, Lukaku was the target man on both the occasions and he failed to convert them. 

Italy predictably adopted a defensive play in the last 20-30 minutes and shut down any Belgian attack that was attempted. 
Overall, Belgium tried and failed, like the usual, and Italy progressed to the semis. 

I'd like to mention Spinazzola as the key man in Italy. He was a key figure in the defence and played wonderfully in attacking too. His diagonal runs from the Left-Back confused the Belgium defence and he was left unmarked on several occasions.
I hope his injury isn't serious and he gets to play against Spain.","Entertainment, Sports, italy, belgium, euro"
The World Trump Created,"It’s a common trope in literature, and probably to some extent a feature of our own lives, that journeys end where they began, either literally or metaphorically. So it’s tempting to see former president Donald Trump’s return to northeastern Ohio this past Saturday for his first campaign-style rally since leaving office as a kind of bookend to the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland. 

It was noticeable before I got to the fairgrounds themselves, as I saw cars festooned with slogans and stickers proclaiming the owners as QAnon believers, and saw people walking around with InfoWars T-shirts. (I even saw one shirt that read “Trump/JFK Jr. 2024,” an allusion to a more-obscure provision of the QAnon catechism that posits that the deceased son of JFK is actually alive, and possibly Q himself). Those, to be fair, were the rarer and more out-there indications of a conspiratorial frame of mind.

Far more common was evidence of a simple belief: The election was stolen. “Not my president” was not exactly an unusual refrain from Resistance liberals during the Trump presidency. But many at this rally seem to have taken this to the next level, wearing shirts that read “Trump won,” and affirming this belief in conversation.

This amount of pressuring in the opponent's final third, the quality of attacking players and the efficiency of the entire team. Absolutely amazing. 
No wonder Belgium is struggling to stay afloat in this match.
Belgium have regularly been tagged as the dark horse of every tournament they take part in. For me, personally, Belgium lacks commitment and conviction. They have incredible talent, yet they lack the push that's needed to win it.

Lukaku's goal through penalty might be the support Belgium needs to turn this fixture around and win the match. However, they are still trailing by one goal and if Italy decides to defend, there's no team in God's green earth that could break their defence. 

Overall, I'm hoping for an excellent second half.

Why Thrift?,"Some of my favorite wardrobe pieces are secondhand. I love telling people my shirt is thrifted, or my trousers from Depop. If you’re hesitant about buying secondhand, here are the reasons I thrift:

1. The Hunt! You never know what you can find in thrift stores. You have to do a bit of searching, sometimes try something on that you’re skeptical about, but you can find some gems among the giant jumpers and grandma shirts. Some of my favorite finds are a 70s head scarf and and possibly 80s sheep jumper! 

2. Sustainability: it’s no secret that the fashion industry is one of the leading pollution creators. While using what you have is the most sustainable option, buying already produced clothing is next. As I work to reduce my carbon footprint, buying secondhand when I can is one of the easiest swaps I can make. A word of caution though - overbuying just because things are secondhand isn’t a sustainable practice, especially as for many people, thrifting is their only or most realistic option. 

3. Money: thrifting is so much cheaper. As a student, I don’t have much money to spend on clothes, but thrifting helps me get everything I need and still have money for books and food. 

4. Unique pieces: when you buy secondhand, you can find pieces that aren’t being produced anymore, or that someone bought out of town, or occasionally homemade items. When in -store trends don’t match my style or what I need, I can usually find something unique and fun secondhand. 

I’ve had some good luck thrifting over the years, and I love that my wardrobe is becoming more sustainable and is full of interesting finds that sometimes have a story. I encourage everyone to go on the hunt for a good secondhand item!","sustainability, sustainable fashion, shopping, thrifting"

Did BJP force Uttarakhand CM to resign to avoid embarrassment of him losing the by-poll?,"The BJP leadership on Friday asked Uttarakhand Chief Minister Tirath Singh Rawat to resign after it was convinced that he will lose the by-election given the anti- incumbency against the ruling party in the hill state. 

That would have caused a huge embarrassment to the BJP given that the assembly elections are due early next year. 

Rawat promptly obliged and submitted his resignation to Governor Baby Rani Maurya late Friday night. 

Rawat had time till September 10 to get elected to the state assembly, as per the requirement under the Representation of the People's Act. 

He had taken over as the Chief Minister from Trivendra Singh Rawat on March 10 after the BJP leadership removed him unceremoniously. 

According to section 151(A) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, a by-election must be held within six months of a vacancy occurring. 

But a clause provides two exceptions for not holding a by-poll and that is if the remainder of the term in relation to the vacancy is less than a year or if the Election Commission, in consultation with the central government, certifies that it is difficult to hold the by-election within the stipulated period.

Rawat later said that he resigned to avoid any Constitutional crisis as he and the BJP leadership were of the view that the Election Commission may not hold the by-polls in the hill state citing the above clause.

But that seems an excuse as the BJP leadership feared that it would be a huge embarrassment for the party if the sitting Chief Minister lost a by-election. 

A meeting of the BJP legislature party has been called in Dehradun on Saturday afternoon to be chaired by state unit president Madan Kaushik. Union Minister Narendra Singh Tomar will be the party's central observer. 

Perhaps this would be the first time in the recent past when a state will have it's third Chief Minister in a span of four months. 

Rawat would continue to be a Lok Sabha member from Garhwal as he had not yet resigned from the Lower House of Parliament. 

It would have been double jeopardy had he done so and the BJP lost that by-poll too.","uttarakhand, bjp, chief minister, by-elections, resignation"

Supreme Court turns down petition from Christian florist in same-sex wedding case,"The Supreme Court on Friday turned down a petition from a Christian florist who refused to create flower arrangements for a same-sex couple, refusing for now to take another case asking when anti-discrimination laws must give way to religious convictions.
Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Neil M. Gorsuch indicated they would have accepted the case. But it requires four justices for a grant, and that means none of the court’s other three conservatives were willing to go along.
A unanimous Washington state Supreme Court found that the florist, Barronelle Stutzman, violated the Washington Law Against Discrimination, a state civil rights law.
In 2013, Stutzman told a friend, Robert Ingersoll, that she would not create arrangements for his wedding to his longtime companion, Curt Freed. Stutzman said she held Ingersoll’s hand and said she had to decline his request because of her “relationship with Jesus Christ.”
She was fined for violating the state’s law that prohibits businesses from discriminating because of sexual orientation. The conservative Alliance for Defending Freedom has been trying to get the Supreme Court to accept the case ever since.
It was seen as a natural follow-up to the court’s 2018 decision in Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission, in which the court sided with a baker who would not create a wedding cake for a same-sex couple celebrating their union.
But the court’s decision in that case was fact-specific: that commission members had been unfairly hostile to Jack Phillips’s religious justifications for his actions. There was no such issue in Stutzman’s case.

Supreme Court ruling: Are voter restriction laws here to stay?,"The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday upheld two voting rules in Arizona, ruling that the restrictions by the state's legislature were not in violation of a critical provision of the Voting Rights Act. [https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-arizona-voting-rights-act/]

The court split 6-3 along ideological lines, with conservative judges ruling in favor of the rules changes after the 2020 elections, while the liberal judges agreed with those arguing that the provisions were aimed against Blacks and minorities.

It was left to Justice Elena Kagan who was explicit in what the majority judgement meant.  “Wherever it can, the majority gives a cramped reading to broad language,” she wrote. “And then it uses that reading to uphold two election laws from Arizona that discriminate against minority voters.” [https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/01/us/politics/supreme-court-arizona-voting-restrictions.html?searchResultPosition=3]

With the Supreme Court ruling coming at a time when the Democratic party is trying to overturn several GOP-led legislations in states on voter restrictions, it may become that much more difficult now.

Attorney General Merrick Garland had vowed to sue Georgia for passing a law that allegedly denies the Black people the right to vote. He may still go ahead with it, but what will come of it if it is placed before the Supreme Court is something many are already debating. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/06/29/merrick-garland-suing-georgia-voting/]

Some argue that the Supreme Court may have effectively shut the door on many liberals hoping to challenge a raft of voter restriction laws passed by several Republican-majority legislatures. 

The ball is now in the Congress’s court to enact laws that will ensure the voting rights of the minorities, but with the GOP not willing to play ball, that may turn out to be a difficult task.

Just British Things,"The internet can give you a crash course on just about any country culture in the world, but there are some things you can only learn by living there. I already knew some things before I moved to Scotland; for example, “pants” here has a very different definition than in the States, so you shouldn’t talk about your pants in public. (Reader, I forget this on the regular.) But even with all the months of watching Tik Toks and reading Reddit threads, there are still a few things that took me by surprise.
 
1.     Sticky toffee pudding. Dates are featured prominently in the recipe list, which might scare some people off—don’t let it! Sticky toffee pudding is delicious. It’s spongy spiced cake with toffee sauce, and it is delicious. Definitely the best thing the Brits ever came up with.
 
2.     Shortened words. This is by no means the hardest bit of slang to understand, but it makes me laugh sometimes. “Perfect” becomes “perf,” “fabulous,” becomes “fab,” and “dissertation” becomes “diss.” There’s absolutely no rhyme or reason to what’s shortened and what isn’t—some of the trending hashtags on Twitter are several words long.
 

3.     Grocery store organization. Hoooo boy. Fellow Americans, if you plan on spending any time in Europe, pencil in a long time to do your grocery shopping. Nothing will be where you think it is.
 
4.     Power sockets. In the UK, each power socket has an on/off switch, so you have to turn it on after you plug something in. This is awesome since it saves energy—you just have to make sure you don’t forget to turn it on.
 
5.     Cheese. British people LOVE cheddar. It makes sense, since it’s an English cheese and doesn’t have to be imported. Picture an entire Super Walmart cheese section. Now imagine that it’s only cheddar. That’s what every grocery store cheese section looks like. I’ve never seen so much of it in my life.

Hike to Steall Falls,"When visiting fort William, hiking Ben Nevis may seem like that’s all anyone is doing. But as someone who wasn’t prepared for a full day, slightly dangerous hike, I loved hiking to Steall Falls in Glen Nevis. 

It was easily one of the most beautiful hikes I’ve been on. We took a path by the river that started at the parking lot below the trailhead, then hiked to the trailhead. That easily added 45 minutes onto the hike but it was worth it. On the actual hike you go along the mountain, largely in the shade, and eventually it opens up into beautiful Glen Nevis. 

From there you can cross the river via rope bridge (which I skipped - I’m only 5 feet tall, and I was scared I wouldn’t be able to reach!) and head right under the falls. If not, you can stay in the glen, set up camp or have a picnic by the river. If the weather was good, I’m sure you could cross the river as it was pretty shallow, but beware - it was cold, and I learned that the hard way! Other necessary preparations include bug spray - beware the midges - and transportation, as service is basically nonexistent past the lower car park, and i don’t think the bus runs up there consistently. 

Overall, the hike wasn’t too hard. Definitely rocky in parts, so bring appropriate shoes and be prepared to do a little climbing, but even though it was largely uphill on the way to the falls, it was shaded and never too steep. Do some good walking beforehand to train and bring some water and you’ll be fine! 

Even from a distance, the falls was quite a beautiful sight. Featured in one of the Harry Potter movies, it’s easy to see why so many shows have been filmed around Fort William. The entire hike, my group and I kept talking about how we couldn’t believe the scenery was real! I can’t wait to go back, and to hike more of Fort William’s gorgeous trails.","travel, nature, hiking, hiking trail, nature photography"

Trump Organization prosecutors confront accusations of political bias,"The Trump Organization wasted little time Thursday before denouncing the indictment of its longtime chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg and condemning state authorities in New York for their “scorched earth attempt to harm” the corporation’s figurehead, former president Donald Trump.
“This is not justice,” the company declared in a four-sentence unsigned statement after Weisselberg, 73, surrendered around dawn. “This is politics.”
Former prosecutors and legal experts who have closely watched the investigation, a joint pursuit by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. (D) and New York Attorney General Letitia James (D), rejected Trump’s assertion that his company and close adviser are being pursued as part of a political vendetta. Authorities understand “the eyes of the world are on this prosecution, and one would think they would . . . bend over backwards not to treat Trump differently,” said Thomas C. Rotko, who handled public corruption and fraud cases in the district attorney’s office.
“It is absolutely vital,” New York University tax law professor Daniel N. Shaviro said, “to prosecute things like this with well-known people to show taxpayers that the law applies to everyone.”

Still, the investigation’s political overtones are inescapable. Trump has seized on comments James made during her 2018 election campaign, when she called him an “illegitimate president” and vowed to investigate his family business. And in the run-up to Thursday’s indictment, Democrats appeared highly attuned to the possibility of political blowback.

Dr Daniel Koch","Since joining European football’s governing body in January 2021, Dr  Daniel Koch has played a key role in ensuring UEFA meets its number one objective for the EUROs – minimising the risks of infection for everyone involved in the tournament, from players and match officials to organisers and the limited numbers of returning fans. 
He is Euro 2020's chief medical adviser. 
This has involved working closely with government and health authorities at all 11 host EURO venues and helping the governing body produce its own minimum health and hygiene requirements to supplement local regulations in each country.

After studying medicine in the Swiss capital of Bern and qualifying as a physician, in 1988, Dr Koch joined the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). During his 14-year career with the ICRC, he served as medical coordinator in Sierra Leone, Uganda, South Africa and Peru. In 1996/97, Dr Koch obtained a Master's degree in public health (MPH) at the renowned Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore in the United States.

As well as serving as the head of communicable diseases at Switzerland’s Federal Office of Public Health, Dr Koch also oversaw the pandemic preparedness and vaccination sections.

Morphed ABP News graphic shows Rahul Gandhi wants India to be Islamic nation,"By Kalim Ahmed

A screengrab of an alleged ABP News graphic plate airing a tweet of Wayanad MP Rahul Gandhi is viral on social media. The screenshot has two captions on top. The first states, “Even after seeing this tweet of Pappu aired on ABP News TV channel, those who choose to support the Congress party will not only betray their country but also their religion.”

[Translated from: सही निर्णय आपकी सोच। एबीपी न्यूज़ टीवी चैनल पर भी दिखाया गए पप्पू के इस ट्वीट को देखने के बाद भी जो कांग्रेस का समर्थन करेगा वो वास्तव में अपने देश : तथा धर्म) से गद्दारी ही करेगा।]

The second caption reads, “Rahul Gandhi has tweeted this just now from Wayanad, all members of this group must read this.”

[Translated from: अभी-अभी राहुल गांधी वायनाड से ट्वीट किए हैं आप सभी ग्रुप के मेंबर यह ट्वीट जरूर पढ़ना !!]

( Link https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=5385202474853370&id=640423749331290)


The alleged tweet by Rahul Gandhi says that the BJP is following the agenda of Hindu Rashtra by passing the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. “The agenda of our ancestors has always been an Islamic country which is why we created two Islamic countries, Pakistan and Bangladesh. We can’t witness India becoming a Hindu Rashtra,” it further states.

[Original text in Hindi: नागरिकता बिल पास करा कर बीजेपी हिंदू राष्ट्र के एजेंडे पर चल रही है हमारे पूर्वजों का एजेंडा हमेशा से इस्लामिक कंट्री पर रहा है इसीलिए हमने दो इस्लामिक कंट्री बनाएं पाकिस्तान और बांग्लादेश अब हम भारत को हिंदू राष्ट्र बनते नहीं देख सकते]

Why Communion matters in Catholic life – and what it means to be denied the Eucharist,"The biannual U.S. Catholic bishops’ meeting received more than its usual attention this June due to one particular item on its agenda: a proposed document on the Sacrament of the Eucharist, a ritual also known as Holy Communion.

Because this as yet unwritten document is expected to include guidance on when and whether Holy Communion may be refused to a Catholic who presents her or himself in a manifest state of serious sin, this church matter received note in the pages of national newspapers. It also prompted a “Statement of Principles” from 60 Democratic Catholics in the U.S. House of Representatives urging bishops “to not move forward and deny this most holy of all sacraments.”

As a scholar of Catholic sacramental theology, let me offer some thoughts on the central role of Holy Communion in the Catholic Church, and the pain it can cause some members to be denied reception of it.

One of the seven sacraments of the Catholic Church, the Eucharist is a ritual in which, according to Catholic theology, bread and wine blessed by a priest really become the body, blood, soul and divinity of Jesus Christ. Such is its central role in Catholicism, it has been called the “fount and apex of the whole Christian life.”

Catholics are obliged to receive Communion at least once a year, but in practice many do so far more frequently during Mass, or Catholic public worship.

Why might Catholics be concerned with lacking access to this one practice when there are presumably many other opportunities for spiritual growth both within and without the Catholic Church?

The answer lies not only in a sense of injustice about being denied access or forcing a change of habit. It is found in the history, practice and theology of Holy Communion itself.

Eucharist in early Christianity

In the formative years of Christianity around 2,000 years ago, the practice of ritual meals was already common in both Jewish and Greco-Roman culture. Early Christian Eucharistic practice took seriously the ritual power of a meal to transport participants beyond the physical world by connecting them to both past events and spiritual realities.

What LSE's online exhibition tells about 'Father of Indian Constitution',"""He is not only very able, but an exceedingly pleasant fellow."" This is how Edwin R. A. Seligman, a Columbia University professor described Dr B.R. Ambedkar in his recommendation letter to the London School of Economics (LSE) in 1920. Responding to this effusive letter, LSE Professor Herbert Foxwell replied saying that Ambedkar had “no more worlds for him to conquer” having already completed a doctorate. [https://www.lse.ac.uk/library/whats-on/exhibitions]
 
Both the letters form part of an online exhibition organised by the LSE South Asia Centre in collaboration with the LSE Library and Decolonising LSE Collective. The collection tracks the life of Ambedkar in London from 2016 as a Master’s degree student at LSE and later when he enrolled for the Bar-at-Law degree at Gray’s Inn, and a few years later, a doctoral student. The online exhibition will add recordings, reading lists, podcasts, and other materials about Ambedkar, and it is inviting contributions from the LSE community.
 
His LSE application form, which shows his course fee costing £10 and 10 shillings, is there too. 
 
Ambedkar completed his second doctorate at the LSE with his dissertation 'The Problem of the Rupee'. He dedicated it to his supervisor Edwin Cannan, Professor of Political Economy. It is said that this dissertation was influential in the setting up of the Reserve Bank of India. Ambedkar’s signed dedication to his supervisor, 1924 is part of the exhibition.
 
Ambedkar went to India after his doctorate and involved himself in the independence movement and fought for the 'Dalits' rights, the “Untouchables” considered to be the lowest of the social hierarchy and outside of the Hindu caste system.
 
He came to London during the Mahatma Gandhi's Roundtable talks with the British. A student file shows a letter from his former supervisor Edwin Cannan who wrote to William Beveridge to encourage him to entertain Ambedkar. Talking about Ambedkar in the letter, Cannan says, “I always said he was by far the ablest Indian we ever had in my time”.

Boost to India's creators economy,"It’s been exactly a year since the government pulled the plug on tik tok making the app disappear from app stores within hours. Tik tok was huge in India and its ban left millions of creators without any sort of platform that could match tik tok’s popularity but despite the ban India’s creator economy hasn’t stopped. So what exactly is the industry all about and how is it growing? 
DECODING INDIA’S SURGING CREATOR ECONOMY.
To understand what a creator economy is we need to understand who creators are; a creator is someone who consistently posts contents online. This content can be a niche of their choice it can be anything ranging from a beauty tutorial, live gaming, podcast, short comedy sketches or even vlogs. When the creators gain substantial following on social media, they are called influencers.
RISE OF CREATOR ECONOMY:
After the industrial revolution mass media became an important tool for advertising. Brands marketed their products and services through traditional media. Advertisement patterns stayed relatively same for around 50 years until the internet and social media disrupted it. While advertising is still very relevant in newspapers and television channels for older population; brands are spending on platforms like you tube and instagram to target gen zeddrs and millennial who mostly consume content online.
HOW LOCKDOWN HELPED THE CREATOR ECONOMY BOOM 
. When the pandemic forced the whole world to stay within four walls these numbers went up significantly. Many of us looked at our phones and laptops for entertainment and even for socializing. Many users who felt lonely and needed some sort of socializing felt a deep connection with creators. This helped creators and social media platforms gain more users and giving a huge boost to the industry as the world I now looking to return to normalcy, the industry has its plans set for the future. Lockdown gave rise to new age of content creators and a huge massive pile of content for consumption.","Entertainment, Economy, pixstory, facebook, youtube, influencers, instagram, tik tok"
14. Dial D for Don: Gifts from the Gulf- The Flight to Dubai,"“Gifts from the Gulf” continues…

I returned to the Conference Room, took leave of the Chair and rushed to CBI Headquarters.

 The Director was in a meeting with senior officers in CBI’s Conference Hall but I decided to walk in. I conveyed the news of Aftab’s arrest in Dubai whispering into his ears. He asked me to wait until he wound up the meeting. After hearing details of my conversation with KC Singh he spoke to the Ambassador himself. Thereafter, I was directed to leave for Dubai post haste.

The Indian Airlines flight to Dubai leaving Delhi in the evening was full. Nonetheless, I went to the airport to take my chances. At the Airlines counter I was informed again that finding a seat on the flight was out of the question as there were no cancellations. I had to throw the weight of a senior CBI officer on a special mission with the Airlines authorities and told them that I had to proceed to Dubai, even if it meant travelling in the cockpit! Somehow, they put me on the plane and I was on my way. 

The following morning, I met with senior Dubai officials at our Ambassador’s office. They wanted evidence from me to confirm the identity of the man who was in their custody that he was indeed Aftab Ansari. I handed over a dossier prepared by the Delhi Police with Aftab’s fingerprints. Aftab’s passport file obtained from Patna with his thumb impression was also given. The Dubai officers asked our Ambassador and me to wait until the process of confirming his identity was completed and further orders from their higher ups received.

Pregnant women allowed Covid Jab in India,"*Pregnant Women now eligible for COVID-19 Vaccination*

Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has accepted the recommendations of NTAGI 

Pregnant women may now register on CoWIN or walk-in to the nearest COVID Vaccination Centre (CVC) to get vaccinated. 

Based on recommendations from National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization (NTAGI), the Union Ministry of Health and family Welfare (MoHFW) today approved the vaccination of pregnant women against COVID-19. The decision empowers pregnant women to make an informed choice on taking the COVID vaccination.  The decision has been communicated to all the States/ UTs to implement it under the ongoing National COVID Vaccination Program.
ITill date, all groups except pregnant women were eligible for COVID-19 vaccination. Now, it is expanded to even pregnant women in the world’s largest Immunization drive.
Studies have shown that COVID-19 infection during pregnancy may result in rapid deterioration of health of pregnant women and they are at an increased risk of severe diseases and it might affect fetus too. The matter has been examined by domain knowledge experts based on the evidence that indicate that pregnant women are at an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 compared to non-pregnant women in case they get infected. Further, pregnant women with COVID-19 infection are at an increased risk for preterm birth and other adverse pregnancy outcomes including higher chances of neonatal morbidity. Additionally, the experts have also highlighted pre-existing co-morbidities, advanced maternal age, and high body mass Index as factors for severe COVID-19 in pregnancy.

 ""During the second wave, it was seen that mortality rates of pregnant women infected by COVID-19 had increased by two to three times, in comparison to the first wave. Under such a situation, it was felt that pregnant women should also become beneficiaries of the COVID-19 vaccine. In case of pregnant women, it involves the safety of two lives - the mother and the child in her womb. Hence, the country has decided to vaccinate pregnant women.""

"Is national identity linked with religion and language, as Indian Hindus believe?","Nearly two out of three Hindus in India believe it’s important to be Hindu to be truly Indian. Four out of five also believe it’s important to speak Hindi to be truly Indian, according to a survey. It is not clear how many of them know it, but this is the textbook definition of ethnic nationalism. India is not unique; majority communities, in the US and elsewhere, have been leaning towards ethnic nationalism in recent years. Should national identity be closely tied with the religion and the language of the majority? 

https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/06/29/key-findings-about-religion-in-india/

Pew Research Center conducted the large-scale survey on attitudes about religion in India. Among its ten major findings is this: 84% of all respondents say that to be “truly Indian,” it’s important to respect all religions. Nearly as many also feel doing so is part of their own religion. That sounds nice. Having said that, 64% say it’s important to be Hindu to be truly Indian – and 76% of them say it’s important to stop Hindu women from marrying into another religion. This supports the the ruling BJP party’s campaign against ‘Love Jihad’, the alleged trend of Muslim men luring Hindu women into marriage. Among the Muslim community, opposition to inter-religious marriage is even higher, though. What both major communities seem to want is religious segregation. [https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-57647931]

Such feelings are more pronounced in the north – the ‘Hindi belt’ – than in the south. That leads to another assumption, shared by 59% Hindus, that being able to speak Hindi is a key marker of the national identity. 

No wonder, then, the party who espouses the cause of ethnic nationalism, the BJP, has a substantial support base. Modern ethos of liberalism and democracy would argue against it. India’s Constitution itself puts all citizens on equal footing. A national identity should be the sum of self-image of the nation’s citizens. Various religious communities (and other kinds of groups) have all made their contributions to the nation. Restricting it to a religion or a language would go against the values that inspired the freedom movement.

Job scam convict Chautala finally comes out of jail as a free man after 9 years’ imprisonment,"Rajesh Moudgil

Chandigarh: The Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) supremo and five-time Haryana chief minister  Om Prakash Chautala on Friday finally got out of the Delhi’s Tihar jail after a special remission of six months was recently granted by Delhi government in his 10-yor six year sentence in JBT recruitment scam.

He was welcomed at Delhi-Gurugram border by the party workers from where he went to his residence in Gurugram where he met senior party leaders, family members and workers.

His younger song Abhay Chautala who interacted with newspersons in Chandigarh said that Chautala’s release would rejuvenate the party once again. He said his father would soon visit the farmers at Delhi borders where they are currently protesting against the farm laws. Chautala Sr is currently recovering from a fracture in his arm. Abhay also lashed out at Congress leaders who he alleged had hatched a conspiracy against Chautala Sr to jail him.

The former chief minister Om Prakash Chautala and his elder son Ajay were among over 50 people who were sentenced to 10-year jail in the JBT recruitment scam on January 16, 2013.

The footage is also circulating on Facebook with Tamil and Hindi captions. Pro-BJP propaganda pages Politics Solitics and Mission Modi, and SSB Crack garnered thousands of views for the CCTV footage.

Alt News performed a keyword search which led us to a Times of India report dated July 1, 2021. According to the report, Bharuch police crime branch officers, posing as customers, managed to arrest a group of criminals at a roadside eatery. The accused is identified as wanted man Kishore Luhar who has 14 cases of robbery and rape registered against him. The report informs that he was nabbed from a Dhaba in Amarpura village of Saraswati taluka in Gujarat’s Patan district. Police also recovered a gun from Kishoer. The three individuals dining with him were also arrested.

The Indian Express also covered the incident in a video report. So did News24.

Fact-check: Did LPG cost more during UPA than under BJP government?,"By Archit Mehta

After the fifth increase in LPG refill prices since December 2020, except for a meagre cut of Rs 10 on March 31, 14.2 kg LPG refill will now cost Rs 834.50. However, BJP supporter Rishi Bagree shared a tweet listing LPG cylinders since 2011 and claimed that non-subsidised LPG gas is 32% cheaper than its price during the UPA government.

( Link https://twitter.com/rishibagree/status/1410840093925941260?s=19)

Bagree had tweeted the same earlier in February and in 2020. The claim was widespread on Twitter and Facebook. In the past, Bagree has shared misinformation on multiple instances.

A similar narrative is regularly pushed on social media – that despite the recent increase in LPG price, refills cost cheaper than their price during the UPA rule. National general secretary of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Chikkamagaravalli Thimme Gowda Ravi and National vice president of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BYJM) Santosh Ranjan Rai had made such posts in February.

( Link https://twitter.com/CTRavi_BJP/status/1362663569930657796?s=19)

On Facebook, several users shared this claim in the form of a screenshot of the above-mentioned tweets or an infographic along with Bengali text, amongst other formats.

Fact-check: Misleading data

The viral list creates the impression that the price of LPG cylinders was much higher during Congress’s rule. However, this is a misleading representation of data as neither subsidised prices nor the international price of LPG have been considered.

In order to understand the price of LPG cylinders, this fact-check has been divided into:

1. Analysis of the viral text.
2. What does a higher non-subsidised price 
indicate?
3. How is LPG subsidised?
4. Cost of 14.2 kg LPG cylinder after subsidy

Analysis of the viral text

The prices listed on social media are based on Indian Oil’s webpage that lists the cost of a non-subsidised 14.2 kg LPG cylinder in New Delhi. The data on the Indian Oil website dates back to December 11, 2013.

What’s a ghost kitchen? A food industry expert explains,"While the phrase “ghost kitchen” may conjure up images of haunted houses, the reality is a bit more mundane.

Ghost kitchens are food prep operations with no waiters, no dining room and no parking lot – really, no public presence whatsoever.

But on food delivery apps, they’re alive and well.

In short, ghost kitchens are physical spaces for operators to create food for off-premises consumption. And on apps like Grubhub and DoorDash, listings for restaurants operating out of ghost kitchens usually don’t look any different than those for brick-and-mortar operations. For example, where I live in northern Colorado, there’s a restaurant called Rocco’s Ravioli that appears on the apps. But Rocco’s doesn’t have a storefront. It’s a food delivery service that makes food in a ghost kitchen.
One trend I’m seeing is the formation of central, commissary-style ghost kitchens with multiple restaurants or brands working out of the same physical space. These are often located in industrial parks on the outskirts of cities, since there’s no need to pay downtown rents when there’s no front-of-house operation.

Why ghost kitchens matter

While it’s hard to pinpoint exactly when the first ghost kitchen opened, it was the COVID-19 pandemic that accelerated their growth.

By March 2020, most U.S. jurisdictions had forced restaurants to close their dining rooms to limit the spread of the coronavirus. While some restaurants closed never to reopen, others pivoted to a delivery or carry-out model with varying levels of success.

Some small food operators used ghost kitchens to get a foothold in the market during a time when opening a standard restaurant with a dining room would have been unthinkable. As long as the high fees charged by the major delivery services could be mitigated or built into the price, food delivery outfits working out ghost kitchens could find a way to make a living. Even national chains like Chili’s and Applebee’s used ghost kitchens to keep cash flowing and test new menu items using different brand names in case the ideas flopped.

"Who’s the worst US president in history? (Hint: No, not Trump)","Though he was impeached twice, Donald Trump is not the worst president in the history of the United States. That dubious distinction, in an informal survey of leading historians, goes James Buchanan, who failed to stop the civil war. 

Check the C-SPAN survey:
https://www.c-span.org/presidentsurvey2021/

https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2021/06/30/presidential-rankings-2021-cspan-historians/

https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/30/opinions/c-span-historian-survey-donald-trump-ranking-balcerski/index.html

Trump’s supporters, however, may have little to cheer about: He is placed fourth from the bottom. Even William Henry Harrison, who held the office only for 31 days, is considered better than him, and so is John Tyler, the only former president buried in a coffin draped with the Confederate flag.

Only president’s worse than Trump, according to the 142 presidential historians, are Franklin Pierce (14th president, anti-abolitionist), Andrew Johnson (17th president, first to be impeached) and Buchanan (15th president).

After demitting office, this is the first time Trump has appeared in the survey, and – who knows – history may judge him kindly in future. But for 2000, 2009, 2017 and now, there’s no change in historians’ views about the worst three. 

By the same count, there is no change at the top. Since 2000, the top four positions are held by Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Theodore Roosevelt (Washington and FDR switched places in the 2000 survey.)

The C-SPAN survey is conducted at the end of a presidency, taking a broad view. Selected historians (many more were added this time) are asked to rate each president on 10 ‘leadership characteristics’: public persuasion, crisis leadership, economic management, moral authority, international relations, administrative skills, relations with Congress, vision/setting an agenda, pursuit of equal justice for all and performance within the context of the times. The averages of all of the ratings are then ranked.

Trump was quite good on ‘public persuasion’, placed 32nd. It was on moral authority and administrative skills that he scored the worst – at the very bottom.

The survey, needless to say, cannot be scientific or objective, and reflect the opinions, otherwise known as biases, of the participants. [https://www.c-span.org/presidentsurvey2021/?page=participants]

China and Taiwan Sovereignty,"On Wednesday China marked the hundredth anniversary of the Communist Party. The main event took place in Tiananmen Square, where Chinese students were infamously mowed down by the government decades ago while protesting.

Chinese President Xi Jinping laid out his grand vision for the future. Xi left out nothing of China’s ambitions to be the leading power in the world politically, militarily, and culturally. One overlooked remark was the issue of Taiwan.

China has long claimed that Taiwan is theirs even though Taiwan is a sovereign nation. Jinping said he plans to see Taiwan being officially absorbed into greater China soon. Likely this means it will be taken by force, putting President Biden in an interesting position on how to act. Will Biden send troops to support Taiwan? If not, America’s global hegemony will be gravely threatened.","chinese, china, biden, china-taiwan"

Communist Party of China @ 100: How it controls history to shape future,"Amid its centennial celebrations, the Community Party of China (CPC) has organized history exhibitions [https://www.scmp.com/video/scmp-originals/3138747/exhibitions-and-history-lessons-china-prepares-mark-100-years]. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlmUhs-cFsg] Not everything on display, however, is likely to be true. The CPC would not have such hold over China if the Party’s history were written objectively, without any mythmaking and without brushing ugly parts under the carpet. 

Those who control the present control the past, observed George Orwell, but the reverse is equally true: the CPC tightly controls the past in order to keep the present under control. “The Party treats history as an issue of political management in which the preservation of the Party’s prestige and power is paramount,” wrote Richard McGregor in his ‘The Party: The Secret World of China’s Communist Rulers’. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqrnBEdWqCM]

With Xi Jinping as general secretary since 2012, the Party is even more relentlessly concentrating power at the top, coupled with surveillance and repression, accentuating a trend that began with the founder of the republic, Chairman Mao. As part of this project, Xi has targeted any remaining historians who try to dig out forgotten chapters of the uncomfortable past. They include the untold versions of the Long March (1934-1936), Great Leap Forward (1958 – 1962), Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) and Tiananmen Square protests (1989). Citizens should better remember these events only in accordance with the party line. [https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/7/1/chinas-history-wars] ‘Historical nihilism’ – criticizing Party leaders, defaming national heroes or denying “the excellence of advanced socialist culture” – is a crime is punishable with jail term.

PPF and ELSS are best tax saving investment instruments,"nasqshzeb asked: What is the best tax saving investment plan according to you?


Answer: In my opinion, some of the best tax saving investment plans are - life insurance, public provident fund and equity linked savings scheme (ELSS). 

Now, it is up to the person  to choose. 

PPF is treated as the best tax saving investment plan because of the tax exempt interest. You may choose any ELSE option if you wish so.

The U.S. State Department Begins The Process of Updating Passports With Gender Marker X,"On the last day of Pride Month, the U.S. State Department announced that it’s beginning the process of updating U.S. Passports by adding Gender Marker ‘X’ to more accurately represent non-binary, intersex, and gender non-conforming identities.

Secretary of State, Antony J. Blinken announced: “We will be updating our procedures to allow applicants to self-select their gender as ‘M’ or ‘F’ and will no longer require medical certification if an applicant’s self-selected gender does not match the gender on their other citizenship or identity documents” 

LGBTQI+ organization Lambda Legal announced this as a victory for their plaintiff U.S. Navy veteran Dana Zzyym, who is intersex and non-binary, and has been in a legal fight for six years, for a passport that more accurately represents them. 

“I’ve been at this fight for so long,” Zzyym said in a statement. “I am optimistic that, with the incredible support and work of Lambda Legal and the Intersex Campaign for Equality, I will soon receive an accurate passport. One that reflects who I truly am; and that will allow for me to present in person at the several international conferences to which I’ve been invited to present on issues confronting intersex people.”

The State Department hasn’t given a clear timeline on when the process will be complete, stating that the system updates will take a while, and that they’re working with interagency partners to make travel experiences easier for the passport holder.

In the statement, Blinken added: “The Department is taking these steps after considerable consultation with like-minded governments who have undertaken similar changes. We also value our continued engagement with the LGBTQI+ community, which will inform our approach and positions moving forward. With this action, I express our enduring commitment to the LGBTQI+ community today and moving forward.

Other countries where passports have gender marker options beyond ‘M’ and ‘F’ include Canada, India, Malta, Nepal and New Zealand.

BJP attempts to woo Jayant,"In its efforts to further fragment the Opposition space in poll bound Uttar Pradesh, the BJP is understood to have reached out to new RLD chief Jayant Chaudhary with the offer of a berth in the Union Cabinet. 

After the late J Jayalalithaa successfully employed the strategy of crowding up the anti AIADMK space in the 2016 assembly elections, the BJP has worked on the template in successive assembly elections including last year's Bihar elections and the polls this year in West Bengal. In Bihar, the grouping consisting of AIMIM's Asad Ud din Oweisi, Upendra Kushwaha and Pappu Yadav dented RJD prospects and the AIMIM returned with its best ever performance in the state by annexing five seats. In Bengal, Owesi was not successful, but prospects for him do not appear equally bad in UP, where elections are due in Feb-March 2022. 

If Akhilesh Yadav of the Samajwadi Party is to emerge as the principal challenger to the BJP in the upcoming polls, his party will need to firm up a formal or informal alliance with the RLD, a party that has the Jat farmers of Western UP as it's core support base. The BJP's calculations are that - with Jayant on board - the ire of farmers against the Narendra Modi government's farm bills will get substantially neutralized. 

Jayant's father, the late Chaudhary Ajit Singh, has both done business with and against the BJP. But, in the last three years, the RLD has been a constituent of the Rashta Manch floated by expelled BJP leader Yashwant Sinha. Jayant also attended the recent Rashtra Manch meeting hosted at the New Delhi residence of NCP leader Sharad Yadav. At a time when farmers are up in arms against the BJP government on the farm laws, Jayant may not find it prudent to join hands with the BJP. But realpolitik sometimes moves beyond political prudence. ","uttar pradesh, bjp, yogi aditya nath, jayant chaudhary, rld"

Over 150 fire scientists urge the US West: Skip the fireworks this record-dry 4th of July,"The heat wave hitting the northwestern U.S. and Canada has been shattering records, with temperatures 30 degrees Fahrenheit or more above normal. With drought already gripping the West, the intense heat has helped suck even more moisture from millions of acres of forests and grasslands, bringing dead vegetation in many regions to record-dry levels and elevating the fire danger to its highest categories.

With this combination of extreme drought, heat and dry vegetation, all it takes is a spark to ignite a wildfire.

That’s why over 150 fire scientists, including us, along with fire officials across the West, are urging people to skip the fireworks this Fourth of July and to avoid other activities that could start a blaze.

Humans start the most wildfires on July Fourth

For decades, one of the most striking and predictable patterns of human behavior in the western U.S. has been people accidentally starting fires on the Fourth of July. From 1992 to 2015, more than 7,000 wildfires started in the U.S. on July 4 – the most wildfires ignited on any day during the year. And most of these are near homes.

With this year’s tinder-dry grasslands and parched forests, sparks from anything – a cigarette, a campfire, a power line, even a mower blade hitting a rock – could ignite a wildfire, with deadly consequences.

Year-round, humans extend the fire season by igniting fires when and where lightning is rare. And it is these very fires that pose the greatest threat to lives and homes: Over 95% of the wildfires that threatened homes in recent decades were started by people. Farther from human development – beyond the “wildland-urban interface” – the majority of area burned by wildfires in the West is still due to lightning.

Whether ignited by people or lightning, human-caused climate change is making fires easier to start and grow larger due to increasingly warm, dry conditions. The western U.S. saw these consequences during 2020’s record fire season – and the 2021 fire season has the ingredients to be just as devastating.

covidwarriors Vaibhav Walia on how second wave was mentally challenging.,"As the time is passing, memories are waning, but for the ones who were the part of it, who saw people losing their lives, succumbing to the disease, for them it is all vivid. Covid warriors who have been incessantly working in the field and answering the request of the people in need have lived every life they saved or helped.
Vaibhav Walia is National Secretary Incharge of Chandigarh and National Head Social Media Indian Youth Congress. He has been working with the people in his IYC team to help countless people in the country. They created certain help line numbers and hashtags to help people reach them. ""Anybody who used to tweet to us with that hashtag, we used to provide them with the necessary help."" he said.
Vaibhav is also working to help people in Dehradun, which is his home town. He tells, ""In Dehradun there are very limited hospitals and everyday these hospitals used to be full, we created a database of all the hospitals there and we had all the contacts, as we recieved any help request people in our team used to arrange the hospital beds and other things."" They also distributed isolation kits which contained masks, sanitiser and important medicines. "" We distrusted 500 of these kits and 2000 of ration kits for maids and other  workers in Dehradun"". he told Pixstory.
Vaibhav says that it was a mentally challenging period, people were in dire need of help and sometimes because of the crisis in the country, they couldn't reach everyone. ""People used to think that we had resources but still we were not helping, some used to cry and beg for help, I used to feel distressed seeing this"".
He tells how it was a complete chaos and people were trying to reach from even outside the country, ""There was a girl from US, she wanted to admit his father in hospital, she was ready to give any amount, we helped her father by arranging the hospital and bed without any money, she was quite overwhelmed and even met me personally to thank me"" he said.","covid 19, covid warriors"
Crisis in Congress: How a weak high command allows state satraps to dictate terms?,"The Congress is going through crisis in many states such as Punjab, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand. 

While the leadership is still grappling with the crisis in Punjab where Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh and his former cabinet colleague Navjot Singh Sidhu are engaged in a battle of one-upmanship, a new problem has surfaced in Uttarakhand. 

In the hill state, the Congress has to take a call on new legislature party leader following the death of veteran Indira Hridayesh. 

It wants to appoint current state unit chief Pritam Singh on her position but has so failed to find his replacement. 

There are multiple reasons for that. Pritam Singh wants his favourite Bhuvan Kapri to replace him but former Chief Minister Harish Rawat has proposed the name of Ganesh Goundiyal. 

The leadership is now caught in the crossfire between the two and this has delayed the appointment. It may be noted that assembly elections in Uttarakhand are due early next year.

Similarly, Rajasthan is another state where the leadership is unable to resolve the crisis triggered due to tensions between Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot and senior leader Sachin Pilot. 

The rebellion in the state unit has been surfacing at regular intervals.

The dissidence has also crossed over to neighbouring Haryana where some legislators and senior leaders have issued warning signals insisting it is high time that former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda replaces present state unit head Kumari Selja. 

But the question is why is it happening so frequently now? 

One main reason is the uncertainty at the top. Congress President Sonia Gandhi had been forced to take up the job after her son Rahul Gandhi resigned from the post following the party's debacle in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. 

Though Rahul is for now reluctant to return as the Congress President, all the important decisions of the party are taken by him. 

So, if Rahul is running the party with Sonia having taken a backseat, why is he shying away from formally assuming the responsibility. 

As it is the Congress is known for its status-quoist approach and this confusion at the top has further slowed the decision making in the party.","congress, rahul gandhi, sonia gandhi, confusion, satraps"
BR Ambedkar and LSE,"London School of Economics is currently hosting an online exhibition [Educate, Agitate, Organise] featuring Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar's whole student Life at LSE. 

BR Ambedkar is an inspiration to many, especially the Dalit-Bahujan community of India. Born to a Dalit Community (considered to be one of  the lowest communities/castes according to the Hindu social heirarchal order) Ambedkar had faced and witnessed extreme caste-based discrimination his entire life. 

The prejudices faced by him did not stop him from being one of the finest, most exceptional, and qualified learned scholars of the country. 
A renowned jurist, economist, politician, writer, anthropologist, and social reformer - he challenged the Hindu religion and its unjust social practices, specifically voicing his views against the system of castes. 

There are many contributions made by Ambedkar towards the formation of a Liberal, Equal, and Fraternal Indian society. From the establishment of the Reserve Bank of India, to the drafting of the Indian Constitution - the country owes a lot to him and his ideas. 
The Bahujan Community (especially the Dalits) see his as an icon as he extensively worked for the community's emancipation and also inspired the Dalit-Buddhist movement. 
He truly deserves the title of being the true 'Father of the Nation'. 💙

Coming back to the context of the online exhibition put by LSE, we see Ambedkar's entire journey as being a student in the University. Joining LSE in 1916 by winning a scholarship, he opted for classes in Political ideas, social revolution, and Geography. 
He came back to LSE for a second time to earn his PhD and eventually publish his thesis 'The Problem of The Rupee'.

Supreme Court blunts voting rights in Arizona – and potentially nationwide – controversial,"Arizona may keep two voting laws that Republicans say protect election integrity and Democrats believe will make it harder for some residents to cast ballots.

That’s the United States Supreme Court’s decision in Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee, one of the decade’s most important voting rights cases.

One Arizona law challenged in the case, H.B. 2023, makes it a felony for anyone other than a family member, caregiver or postal worker to collect and deliver ballots. The other requires ballots to be cast in the assigned precinct where a voter lives. If a person votes at the wrong polling place, Arizona election officials will reject their ballot.

The Democratic National Committee argued at the Supreme Court that both Arizona rules disproportionately hurt minority voters. The majority of justices, split 6-to-3 along ideological lines, disagreed.

“Voting necessarily requires some effort and compliance with some rules,” Justice Samuel Alito wrote for the court’s majority on July 1, 2021. Merely making it more “inconvenient” for certain groups to vote does not violate federal law, according to the court.

The ruling will have national consequences. Arizona is one of 14 states restricting third-party ballot collection. It is one of 26 that require in-precinct voting.

The Supreme Court’s decision makes it more difficult to legally challenge such laws, which, according to our research on elections, significantly affect voting, particularly among racial minorities and the poor.

From Arizona to the Supreme Court

In Arizona, nearly 80% of voters in 2018 cast their ballots by mail. But mail service is not always available in rural areas of the state where many Hispanic and Native Americans live. Only 18% of Native Americans in the state, for example, have access to home mail delivery.

The Tohono O'odham reservation, which covers an area larger than Rhode Island and Delaware, has no home delivery and only one post office. These rural voters often rely on friends or get-out-the-vote workers to deliver their ballots to polling stations.

Ambedkar could be construed as too much of a threat: he wanted to throw down the oppressive shackles that society imposed on so many. You cannot read Ambedkar and be content with the system. Everything about his life and work is designed to make you furious with the system. One of the greatest men who has ever lived- his work ought to be taught to all children from an early age.",ambedkar

Xi’s speech has a message for India,"Xi’s speech yesterday was one of the most anticipated in his nearly nine years in power and was all the more significant because he seeks to extend his rule. He trumpeted the party’s successes in limiting Covid-19’s spread, reducing poverty and quashing dissent in Hong Kong. But most controversially, he said that “The Chinese people will never allow foreign forces to bully, oppress or enslave us.” 

Xi added, clad in a Mao suit: “Whoever nurses delusions of doing that will crack their heads and spill blood on the Great Wall of steel built from the flesh and blood of 1.4 billion Chinese people.”

What should India make of this? Very simply, the future doesn’t augur well for Sino-India relations. And there is little chance that a weakened India, with the power gap increasing between Beijing and Delhi, can diminish Chinese bullying under Xi. The pressure points are all known. It could be Arunachal Pradesh tomorrow or the death of the Dalai Lama. What is going to be India’s strategy?",china
World UFO Day ; Acknowledge the existence of UFOs,"UFO is an unidentified flying object that cannot be identified or explained immediately. The term UFO is used to report sightings of extraterrestrial spaceships that pass by or visit the earth.

World UFO Day is observed and celebrated on 2 July every year to raise awareness about Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) and alien life forms. The day aims to discuss and educate people about UFOs, flying saucers, and sightings of bright blue light in the sky that make headlines across the world. The day is celebrated by some on June 24, and others on July 2.

In 2001, an organisation called World UFO Day Organisation (WUFODO) decided to celebrate this day on 2 July. Because on this day, most UFO enthusiasts gathered together to show ‘evidence’ of extraterrestrial life.","universe, space travel"

He was our last chance. When we entered his office, a modest workplace, one look at the middle-aged unassuming man convinced me that we had come to the right place. He greeted us politely and lent us a sympathetic ear as we shared the details of our case with him and requested him to defend us. After hearing us out, he consented to appear for us on one condition. We had to first convince him that the firing by the police at INA market had indeed been necessary.

Several briefings followed after this first meeting wherein I, along with my officers, struggled to justify our actions with evidence, legal provisions and police rules. The lawyer grilled us for hours, often making us feel frustrated and dejected. We felt guilty even without a trial. But, like any competent lawyer, he did his due diligence to convince himself that he was defending a police action that was necessary and justified. Finally, he informed us he was ready to represent us in court. The hearings in the PIL went on for months. On the days of important hearings, I would make it a point to be present in the court. To see Gurcharan Singh take on the advocates appearing against us and give them a run for their money was to witness court craft at its very best. Whenever I couldn’t attend court, Gurcharan Singh would drive down to my office after the hearings and brief me on the proceedings of the day. When I was unavailable, he would call me to keep me updated. Over a period of time, despite the years between us, Gurcharan Singh and I forged a close bond of friendship

They were about to burn down a post office, and we had to open fire at the crowd, during which one rioter was injured. These proceedings were caught on camera by Newstrack—a popular video magazine during those days. Newstrack’s cameras captured four policemen carrying an injured person away from the scene in a rather unacceptable manner by holding him by his arms and legs while his torso hung loose. The programme in its report highlighted how the four cops hadn’t deemed it necessary to use a stretcher, which made it a revolting sight to watch. The fact of the matter was that it was expedient to remove the injured at the soonest for prompt medical attention. The video was viewed widely and the police in my district came under huge criticism. A PIL was filed against the south district police in the Delhi High Court. The advocates who filed the PIL owed allegiance to a national political party opposed to the Janata Dal government in power.

The best lawyers in the country were to appear against us in the PIL hearings. We were in dire need of a good lawyer to present our side of the story. To our dismay, not a single advocate worth his salt was prepared to take up our case. The case had become too sensational and political, with public opinion riding high against us. We requested one lawyer after another to come on board and argue on our behalf, but none was ready to accept our brief. We were losing heart and getting desperate when someone suggested the name of Bawa Gurcharan Singh. Our inquiries revealed that he was an experienced and competent advocate who was apolitical and kept a low profile but was sincere and effective.

I decided to meet Gurcharan Singh and went to his residential office in Model Town along with some of my officers.

The Playfield: An initiative by the sports journalists to support their fellow journalists,"World Sports Journalists Day

The Playfield: An initiative by the sports journalists to support their fellow journalists, who lost their jobs during the pandemic  
 
By Saurabh Duggal 
 
The COVID pandemic is continuously pushing millions of people into unemployment, underemployment and working poverty. In India too, it has hit almost all the professions and media is one of the worst impacted sectors, with continuous lay-offs of the journalists. 

The loss during the pandemic gave birth to a media initiative ‘The Playfield’, an e-magazine. An initiative by some of India’s reputed sports journalists to support their fellow journalists, who lost their jobs during the pandemic.

“Many of the sports journalists have lost jobs during the pandemic. The ones based at smaller stations were the worst hit, with few alternative options left for them to get back on the track. So, we came up with an idea to roll out a subscription based e-magazine. All the money we are getting through subscriptions and donations, we are financially helping the sports journalists, who are in need,” says senior sports journalist Vijay Lokapally, who has also written several books on the country’s biggest cricketing stars. “The account of ‘The Playfield’ is transparent and anyone can check anytime. We are getting the write-ups from the top names and from abroad too, and everyone is doing it for free. To meet logistics of the first-five issues of the e-magazine, we had to pitch in money from our own pockets, as we all decided not to use the donations for the production purpose. The donation money has to go to support the journalists.”

Senior journalists Vijay Lokapally, R Ramachandran, Manoj Chaturvedi, R Kaushik, Sukhwant Basra, , Ashwin Krishnan, Nikhil Naz, Purnemaa Narayanan; Austin Coutinho (cartoonist) and Vidushpat Singhania (Legal Consultant) are leading the initiative for a cause. Cricket star Harbhajan Singh and hockey legend Zafar Iqbal are also part of the advisory board of ‘The Play field’. 

The first issue of the fortnight 20-page e-magazine ‘The Playfield’ came on January 2. The 13th edition will be released on July 3.

You too can contribute for a cause by subscribing ‘The Playfield’ for Rs 25 per edition.","Sports, pandemic, covid, media, world sports journalists day, the playfield"

Quote of the day✨,"Real success is the struggle, pain, overcoming fears and obstacles throughout life. Stories of those who have it far worse tell us that the body, both physically and mentally, can be taken to great depths. This hits home and we begin to believe amazing things can happen if you don’t give up. The reality and sad truth is we, at some point, give up because our belief systems have diminished for some reason as we embark on our journey.

How do you impulsively develop the never give up attitude? One word that personifies a never give up attitude is responsibility. I am the one responsible for creating the reality that I visualized in my thought processes. If I truly want it, then I must get up because it is now or never.","motivation, self help"

How much does people trust in the news?,"Reuters institute released its 2021 Digital News Report this week which polled 92,000 consumers in 46 markets about a range of digital news topics ranging from the pandemic's impact on consumption to the progress of paid business models as well as trust and misinformation. When it comes to the latter, the research found that overall trust in the news rebounded strongly over the past year across the majority of the 46 markets analyzed.

Finland had the highest share of respondents agreeing ""you can trust news most of the time"" at 65 percent which marks a nine percentage point increase since the last edition of the report. The United States made little progress and it is rock bottom of the report with only 29 percent of people trusting the news most of the time.

The research states that the trust gains across most markets might be due to extensive coverage of Covid-19 which may have had the effect of making news more straightforward and fact-based in addition to pushing partisan politics off the main agendy. According to the report, the United States did not record the gains seen in other countries due to deep division about an allegedly stolen election as well as the aftermath of George Floyd's killing.","news, misinformation, trust"
Belgium's tryst with Euro so far! In stats.,"Belgium's biggest achievement to date was reaching the final of this tournament in 1980, when they lost 2-1 to West Germany in Rome.

• In 2016, Belgium's first EURO finals since they co-hosted UEFA EURO 2000 with the Netherlands, a team coached by Wilmots finished second in Group E and beat Hungary 4-0 in the round of 16 – their biggest EURO finals victory – only to suffer a 3-1 quarter-final defeat by Wales.

• This time round, Roberto Martínez's side won all ten of their qualifiers to finish first in Group I, increasing the number of countries to have reached the finals with a perfect record to eight, Italy also having achieved the feat in the UEFA EURO 2020 preliminaries. Of the previous six to have won every qualifier, however, only Spain (2012) went on to win the tournament itself.

• The 9-0 win against San Marino on 10 October 2019 is Belgium's biggest UEFA European Championship victory.

• Belgium were the top scorers in qualifying overall with 40 goals in their ten matches. Fifteen different Belgium players found the net in qualifying.

• The Red Devils conceded only three goals, the joint best record along with Turkey.

• Eden Hazard and Kevin De Bruyne both provided seven assists in qualifying, fewer only than the Netherlands' Memphis Depay (eight). Hazard scored five goals to De Bruyne's four; Romelu Lukaku managed seven goals and four assists.","italy, football, belgium, euro 2020"

Great Judgement for feeding the street dogs,"Street Dogs deserve feed.


In a big announcement on 1st of July Delhi High Court said Stray Dogs have the right to food. But human committees should feed them with caution. This was a commendable judgement for the good of street dogs till date for me because I never thought such cases were also dealt with in courts. We are taught to feed them either by giving them a chapati or biscuit. This is a good deed to feed animals. And animals return the same by protecting us from thieves. There is a kindness based relationship between humans and animals. So we should do our best to maintain this relationship. 

The Delhi High Court has said this judgement after observing that in exercising this right care and caution should be taken to ensure no harassment or nuisance or any harmful act to the stray dogs. There are many cases of animal cruelty. Current one was when a Youtuber blew his pet dog tight with balloons.  After this video strict actions were taken against him and the court also instructed people to not repeat such things again otherwise much stronger action could be taken against them. 

Feeding the stray dogs has been a blissful act; it keeps the humanity in us alive. Humanity is the first act of being humans. Human relationships with animals keep the ecosystem well maintained. So through this judgement a great effect will be on the ecosystem. As we know there is a definite food chain in our ecosystem to maintain the balance in the ecosystem. Dogs are carnivores. Humans can feed them obviously.  The relationship is unique. We have heard of many stories where dogs helped humans in bad cases. People also like to keep  them as pets and hence the relationship is beautiful and trustful. This shouldn't be broken. Stray dogs are similar but because no one keep them at their home needn't they be bad only.  In fact they should be treated in same way and they deserve it.

Importance of Romelu Lukaku as Belgium take on Italy,"Italy's exciting team at UEFA EURO 2020 is built on a bedrock of talent from Serie A, which supplies 22 of the 26-man squad. Yet the division's Most Valuable Player, the man whose 24 goals and ten assists inspired Inter to end Juventus's dominance, is not among them. On Friday, he will be against them.

Romelu Lukaku has taken the Italian top flight by storm since arriving in August 2019 following a mixed spell at Manchester United. He scored on his Inter debut, against Lecce, and the goals have flowed ever since: 47 in 72 outings, to be precise, with 12 assists.

Two years in Italy have improved him,"" Claudio Ranieri wrote in his column for La Gazzetta dello Sport. ""The trust and responsibility that Antonio Conte gave him have strengthened him internally. He is a tank, he scores naturally, he does not miss a game.""

Conte himself describes Lukaku as ""a force of nature"", which feels like an apt description for a man who has scored 46 goals in his last 45 international outings.","italy, belgium"

Supreme Court strikes down California’s nonprofit donor disclosure requirements,"The Supreme Court tossed out a California law requiring nonprofits to report their major donors to state officials. In a 6-3 ruling, the court said the law, intended to fight fraud, subjected donors to potential harassment and violated their First Amendment rights. Dana Brakman Reiser, a legal scholar on nonprofits, explains the case, known as Americans for Prosperity v. Bonta, and the significance of the court’s decision.

1. What was the case about?

Two conservative nonprofit groups, Americans for Prosperity Foundation and the Thomas More Law Center, sued California’s government over its requirement that the identity of a charity’s biggest donors be shared with the state’s attorney general.

Though the disclosure is made to the state, not the public, both groups claimed that California failed to sufficiently safeguard the names of donors, resulting in numerous data leaks. The litigants argued that given the potential of disclosure by California’s authorities, donors who support controversial charities could reasonably fear harassment if the public learned their identities.

On those grounds, Americans for Prosperity Foundation and the Thomas More Law Center accused the state of hindering their constitutionally guaranteed freedom of association. A diverse array of nonprofits, including the American Civil Liberties Union and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, agreed and urged the court to block California’s disclosure rule.

California countered by arguing that donor information is necessary to combat charity fraud and that, especially after adjustments made during the litigation, donor names submitted to the state are now secure. The United States and a group of prominent nonprofit law scholars filed briefs in support of California’s position.

2. What does the ruling mean?

California will no longer be able to mandate that charities disclose their donors to the state as a matter of course.

The majority opinion by Chief Justice John Roberts recognized the state’s important interest in rooting out charity fraud but held that a donor disclosure system can be maintained only if it is narrowly tailored to meet the government’s needs. The court found California’s law, on the other hand, to be overly broad.

Mysore & More: Deep India connect of new US interim envoy to New Delhi,"Ambassador Atul Keshap, a career member of the Senior Foreign Service, has been appointed to the US Embassy in New Delhi by Joe Biden administration to serve as Chargé d’Affaires, ad interim.

He served at the International Labour Organisation and several other UN agencies. 

Atul Keshap was born in June 1971 in Nigeria and he was one of four children who grew up across countries like Lesotho, Zambia, Afghanistan and Austria.

After his international stint, K.C. Sen returned to India and settled in Mysuru. He came to Mysuru after 10 years, post-retirement where he founded a charity institution and called it ‘Lost Cause-Mini Fund’, the star of nysore reported.

Will Switzerland  be lucky against Spain to get their second win in 23 matches!,"Well,  Switzerland wrote history once against France; now they want to pen a whole new chapter when they face Spain in Saint Petersburg on Friday

However, Switzerland's record against Spain casts a shadow on their chances against the three-time European champions. 

The Swiss have managed just one victory in 22 games against La Roja, a remarkable 1-0 triumph at the 2010 FIFA World Cup that did not stop Spain from winning the whole thing. Other than that, five draws and 16 losses.

The two most recent fixtures, last autumn in the UEFA Nations League, yielded a 1-0 defeat in Spain and a 1-1 draw at home. 

Switzerland executed Vladimir Petković's plan against France, and we can expect them to do the same against Spain. A very organised Swiss side did well to control the France strikers, with two solid midfielders in Xhaka and Remo Freuler helping out the back three. They will surely employ a similar approach in Saint Petersburg, aiming to give as little space as possible to the Spain midfield.","football, spain, switzerland, euro 2020"

The country has been mostly dependent on China and Russia to meet its food requirements, but after the Covid-19 outbreak, North Korea closed its borders to the outside world, resulting in almost zero trade with the outside world.

Curiously, Kim has also lost weight, and it was the topic of discussion in the tightly-controlled state television with people interviewed saying that it ""broke their hearts"" to see their supreme leader looking ""emaciated."" [https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1456650/kim-jong-un-health-latest-weight-loss-pictures-latest-north-korea-pyongyang-news]

It is unlikely that Kim would open the borders to the neighbors or the wider world as he recently criticized his officials a ""grave incident"" that led to ""huge crisis."" He was talking about Covid-19 situation in the country.

Reports from South Korea say that while the country may face a considerable food crisis because of crop failure and bad weather,  it may not reach the terrible levels of the 90s. [https://edtimes.in/why-is-there-a-major-food-shortage-in-north-korea-that-could-lead-to-millions-of-deaths/]

Some say that Kim could take advantage of the famine-like conditions and Covid-19. Citing Covid, he could bar imports while by getting a tighter grip on the distribution of food. [https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/04/12/north-koreas-leader-warns-famine]

The US drug industry used to oppose patents – what changed?,"The United States, Europe and other wealthy parts of the world have already vaccinated large parts of their populations, yet vaccine rates in poor countries are lagging badly. That’s why the surprise announcement this spring that the United States will support waiving patent protections on COVID-19 vaccines is so important.

Drugmakers quickly voiced their opposition to the move, but public health advocates were elated. Waiving patent rights, the thinking goes, will give poorer countries the ability to procure low-cost generic versions of COVID-19 vaccines, even if they are produced in another country, and help them to more effectively fight a public health crisis. The European Parliament now supports the idea as well.

A patent waiver would have major implications for global vaccine production, of course. But the U.S. announcement should also be understood in the context of longstanding debates about pharmaceutical patenting in the United States.

I am a historian who has studied these debates extensively. What is clear from my work is that heated disputes about the morality of drug patenting date back to the earliest days of the American Republic, as do efforts to limit – or even ban – patents on pharmaceuticals. Support for sharply limiting patent rights on drugs, or even eliminating them altogether, is far from the radical position that some critics imply. Indeed, in many ways it is a deeply conservative one.

Establishment opposition

In the United States, the first patent on a medicine was granted in 1796 for “Dr. Lee’s Windham Bilious Pills,” which was used to treat digestive and other problems. Over the next century, drug manufacturers produced an endless flood of products protected by both patents and trade secrets. Most of these remedies could be easily assembled in a pharmacy, and some clearly helped people.

Yet these so-called “patent medicines” were also highly controversial. Physicians and other critics loudly denounced them because many were advertised with false or misleading claims. Physicians also recoiled at the effort to monopolize these products.

Why scientists are urging UK to expand list of Covid symptoms,"The list of common symptoms in the United Kingdom for those infected with the coronavirus are reasonably straightforward--high temperature, a new continuous cough and losing a sense of smell or taste.

Scientists in the UK think that the government needs to expand this list. One of them advocating this is Professor Calum Semple, a member of the government's Sage committee of scientific advisers tracking the virus closely in the UK and the world.

In an article published in the British Medical Journal, a group of researchers say that by expanding the list, the people will act with responsibility and it would be easy to control the spread. ""To reopen society with greater speed and fairness, control of transmission must improve,"" they write. ""This starts with an expanded and more context appropriate case definition and rests on adaptive, locally grounded, and information-led public health responses.""

The researchers argue that the UK should learn from other countries which have a wide range of symptoms. For instance, the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has as many as 14, including sore throat, runny nose and muscle or body aches. Even the World Health Organization has more symptoms.

Delta variant's new symptoms could also be one of the reasons in favor of expanding the list. [https://theconversation.com/the-symptoms-of-the-delta-variant-appear-to-differ-from-traditional-covid-symptoms-heres-what-to-look-out-for-163487]

Even the Office for National Statistics Covid-19 Infection Survey has reported more cough, headache, and fatigue symptoms. Muscle ache, for instance, was reported by a quarter of people and 32 per cent reported had a sore throat among those tested positive. [abc.net.au/news/health/2021-06-23/covid-symptoms-common-cold-headache-runny-nose-testing-winter/100235058]

While the UK's decision to have a limited list of symptoms was to avoid confusion with other infections and more accessible communication, the time may have come to define other symptoms. ""Expanding the clinical case definition of COVID-19, the criteria for self-isolation, and eligibility for symptomatic testing could improve the UK's pandemic response.""

With the UK record over 25,000 cases per day, many of them with new variants, the government may have to listen to the scientists.

"""It was like going to war"": Young doctor remebers Covid ward duty","The pandemic has challenged us in a way that I could have never imagined,” said Dr Pruthu Narendra Dhekane, Consultant- Infectious Diseases, Fortis Hospitals Bannerghatta Road, Bengaluru while talking to NDTV about his experience of fighting the pandemic from frontline. 

 The 33-year-old Dr Dhekane, who is one of the youngest doctors at Fortis Hospitals, has been serving in the Covid ward since the beginning of the pandemic without any break.

Recounting his experience, he told the Indian television channel that those days going to a Covid ward like going to war. 

""When we are able to cure a patient and send him home and when patients say that they are feeling better, that is something very motivating. But in some unfortunate times when we are not able to save a patient despite our best efforts, then also, as a medical challenge, it keeps us motivated to know what else could have been done to save the patient"", he told NDTV.

Transgender Miss USA contestant: Will more beauty contests open doors,"""My win is our win. We just made history. Happy pride,"" wrote Kataluna Enriquez on her Instagram page after winning the Sunday's Miss Nevada USA pageant contest.

 Kataluna is the first transgender woman to win in Nevada and become the first openly transgender Miss USA contestant ever. She will compete for the Miss USA pageant in November.

 The win comes when many beauty contest organizations allow only ""natural-born"" females to compete. For instance, the Miss United States of America organization (different from Miss USA), doesn't allow transgender women to participate in its contests. A transgender woman, Anita Noelle Green, even sued the organization accusing it of discrimination for denying her the right to participate in the competition. But a court ruled in favor of the organization. [https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/2021/02/judge-dismisses-transgender-womans-suit-against-miss-united-states-of-america-pageant.html]

The significance of Kataluna's success was not lost on Greene. ""This is a historic moment for the trans community,"" she wrote in a Monday Facebook post following Enriquez's win. ""Congratulations Kataluna! This is such an honor! I'm so, so happy for you!!!"" [https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/06/30/kataluna-enriquez-miss-nevada-usa/]

Will Kataluna's victory open more doors to transgender women like her in women's beauty contests?

The organization that conducts the Miss Universe, arguably the most well-known annual beauty contest, has been open to transgender women to compete since 2012. But it was only in 2018 that Ángela Maria Ponce Camacho of Spain became the first transgender woman contestant to compete in the Miss Universe contest. She didn't win the competition, but she opened the doors for others.  Kataluna may follow her if she wins the Miss USA contest.

Miss World, another organization that organizes annual beauty contests for women, is unclear in its rules about the transgender women participating in it. With more and more transgender women participating, it may have to take a clear stand.

Victories like that of Kataluna may also encourage many countries to include transgender women in regular beauty contests. Besides the US, Panama, Spain, Canada, and Nepal are some countries that allow transgender contestants to take part in the Miss Universe beauty pageant.

Nitish govt suffers blow as minister resigns;BJP MLA says 80% ministers corrupt,"The brewing discontent in the ruling alliance in Bihar over the governance matter surfaced on Thursday with social welfare minister Madan Sahni tendering his resignation.
In another embarrassment to the Nitish Kumar-led government, a senior BJP legislator Gyanendra Singh Gyanu  alleged that ministers in connivance with bureaucrats were indulging in massive corruption in the customary transfer and posting of officials.
It is said that the minister Sanhi, who represents Janata Dal United (JDU) in the cabinet, put in his papers following a dispute with his department executive head and additional chief secretary Atul Prasad over transfer of his pet officers to their choice of posts.
As part of large-scale transfer in June, which are done at the ministers’ level, hundreds of officers including deputy development commissioners, district transport officers, circle officers, block development officers, inspectors, engineers, etc, have been transferred in the last week of the last month.
BJP legislator Gyanu, considered close to CM Nitish Kumar, urged the Central party leaders to step in and stop illegal earnings of the ministers by resorting to large-scale shuffle, as the trend would tarnish the image of the party, which is major partner in the government.
The opposition parties are already on the offensive against the government, predicting the premature collapse of the government. 
Opposition leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav had said that the government would fall within the next couple of months owing to internal discontent.
Congress leader Premchandra Mishra said that the causes for minister’s resignation and the BJP legislator’s allegations that 80% of ministers are corrupt bespoke about the state of affairs in the government.","corruption, bihar, tejashwi prasad yadav, premchandra mishra, mitesh kumar, madan sahni, atul prasad, gyanendra singh gyanu, transfer posting"
13. Dial D for Don: Gifts from the Gulf- Aftab Ansari Finally Arrested?,"“Gifts from the Gulf” continues…

When Brajesh Mishra said he would call the US Ambassador to his office the following day, the Prime Minister retorted that it should be done immediately. Presumably, before Director CBI telephoned me, the US Ambassador had been spoken to and he was willing to help. He was waiting for a dossier on Aftab Ansari at the US Embassy before proceeding further. Director, CBI asked me if I could get the dossier from my office and hand it over to the US Ambassador. I said the dossier was with me in my briefcase and I could reach it in five minutes. I then lived in Chanakya Puri in a government accommodation, close to the American Embassy. When I reached the Embassy on Shanti Path, I was taken to its Banquet Hall. A dinner was being hosted in the honor of the visiting FBI Chief by the US Ambassador to India Robert Blackwill. A dossier with a photograph of Aftab Ansari, his Dubai mobile number, passport details etc. was received by a senior embassy staffer on behalf of the Ambassador. I returned home a happy man. We had practically pulled out all the stops and done everything that was possible for us to get the fugitive.
 ________________________________
On February 5, 2002 I was in a meeting at the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) in their office on Parliament Street when Ambassador Singh called me on my mobile from Abu Dhabi. I excused myself from the meeting to take his call. ‘‘‘Aap ka banda pakad liya hai, aap jaldi Dubai aa jao (Your guy has been arrested. Come to Dubai soon)’’’, said the Ambassador in a matter of fact and officious manner.

Why do conspiracy theories flourish? Because the truth is too hard to handle,"Opinion 
By Edward Snowden

""People need to explain to themselves their immiseration, their disenfranchisement, their lack of power. Conspiracies do that"" Edward Snowden

The greatest conspiracies are open and notorious – not theories, but practices expressed through law and policy, technology and finance. Counterintuitively, these conspiracies are more often than not announced in public and with a modicum of pride. They’re dutifully reported in our newspapers; they’re bannered on to the covers of our magazines; updates on their progress are scrolled across our screens – all with such regularity as to render us unable to relate the banality of their methods to the rapacity of their ambitions.

The party in power wants to redraw district lines. The prime interest rate has changed. A free service has been created to host our personal files. These conspiracies order, and disorder, our lives; and yet they can’t compete for attention with digital graffiti about pedophile satanists in the basement of a DC pizzeria.

This, in sum, is our problem: the truest conspiracies meet with the least opposition.

Or to put it another way, conspiracy practices – the methods by which true conspiracies such as gerrymandering, or the debt industry, or mass surveillance are realized – are almost always overshadowed by conspiracy theories: those malevolent falsehoods that in aggregate can erode civic confidence in the existence of anything certain or verifiable.

In my life, I’ve had enough of both the practice and the theory. In my work for the United States National Security Agency, I was involved with establishing a top secret system intended to access and track the communications of every human being on the planet. And yet after I grew aware of the damage this system was causing – and after I helped to expose that true conspiracy to the press – I couldn’t help but notice that the conspiracies that garnered almost as much attention were those that were demonstrably false: I was, it was claimed, a hand-picked CIA operative sent to infiltrate and embarrass the NSA; my actions were part of an elaborate inter-agency feud.

Zee News publishes 2015 story with false claim of human faeces served to ‘non-Muslims’,"By Priyanka Jha

A year-old report of two restaurant owners in the UK booked for serving food mixed with human faeces to their customers have been revived on social media. It has been claimed that the Muslim owners served the contaminated food to non-Muslim customers. It is noteworthy that the article carries no such claim.

( Link https://twitter.com/Ashtalakshmi8/status/1410299283895635969?s=19)

Former CBI interim chief M Nageswara Rao also shared the Newstrack article from last year however, he did not claim that only non-Muslim customers were given the food. But his tweet termed the owners “religious fanatics”, hinting that the act was communally motivated.

( Link https://twitter.com/MNageswarRaoIPS/status/1409797946527256577?s=19)

A screenshot of Rao’s tweet is widespread on Facebook. It was shared on a group called India Against Urban Naxals.

Instagram page Nation Above Self also shared the story writing ‘jihad at rise’.

Zee News has published the story with a communal angle last year

On April 24, 2020 Zee News published a report titled, “(Kabab was served with bodily waste, the mentality of Jamaatis prevails even abroad) कबाब में परोसते थे शरीर की गंदगी, विदेश में भी वही जमाती मानसिकता.” The report has now been updated. The initial version said, “How far can you be saved from religious fundamentalism? Not just in India, but such a mentality is spread worldwide. Two youths in Britain, Mohammad Abdul Basit and Amjad Bhatti serve human bodily waste to non-Muslim customers.” The article received 12,000 shares and 14,000 likes on Facebook where it was shared with the caption, “They used to misbehave with non-Muslims, the truth has come out (गैरधर्म के लोगों के साथ करते थे नीच हरकत, ऐसे सामने आया सच.)”

The article further stated, “There were two restaurant owners here [in Britain] – Mohammad Abdul Basit and Amjad Bhatti. According to reports, they used to mix human faeces in the food and serve it to non-Muslim customers. The duo was running their restaurant for a long time in Nottingham.” The story doesn’t state when the incident took place.

Why university tenure for this journalist is victory for race activism,"When Nikole Hannah-Jones, who had won the Pulitzer Prize for a New York Times essay on slavery, was named a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, there was much discussion over – and opposition to – the granting of tenure to her. After weeks of acrimony overlapping with race debates, the university’s board of trustees has voted in her favor in what had become a flash point in academic wars over the race question.

Hannah-Jones, a correspondent for The NYT Magazine, won the Pulitzer Prize for Commentary in 2020 for her ‘1619 Project’ examining the bitter legacy of slavery:

https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/14/magazine/1619-america-slavery.html

The multimedia series became part of debates over racial discrimination, especially with the Black Lives Matter movement. On the basis of that work, her alma mater, UNC, in April 2021 named her as the ‘Knight Chair in Race and Investigative Journalism’. It is normally a tenured position; the previous two appointees to this chair had full tenure. 

However, there was strong opposition to her appointment from conservative groups. For example, Walter Hussman, an Arkansas newspaper publisher and a donor to the UNC journalism school, objected to it and alleged that her work was “highly contentious and highly controversial”. [https://apnews.com/article/nc-state-wire-nikole-hannah-jones-education-83dc19214604d602bd575cfb2b5dc4ea]

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/magazine/an-update-to-the-1619-project.html
 
The backlash halted the process of granting her the tenure, and the university instead offered her a fixed five-year contract. That decision, obviously, did not go down well with the other side. Those in opposition included not only students, alumni and staff, but also prominent cultural figures and academics. Hannah-Jones engaged lawyers and threatened a discrimination suit. [https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/magazine/an-update-to-the-1619-project.html]

Apart from race and questions over accuracy of her research, the point of debate here was also academic freedom. Should a university go by a donor’s views or stick to its own academic decision?

On Wednesday, the board voted 9-4 in her favor. “This board reaffirms that our university puts its highest values first,” Gene Davis, the board’s vice chairman, said later. Thanking the board and her supporters, Hannah-Jones said, “This fight is about ensuring the journalistic and academic freedom of Black writers, researchers, teachers and students.” [https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/30/business/media/nikole-hannah-jones-unc-tenure.html]","racism, black lives matter, nikole hannah-jones, pulitzer, university of north carolina at chapel hill, 1619 project, knight chair in race and investigative journalism"

NSA spying on journalists,"Fox News host Tucker Carlson issued a bombshell report earlier this week announcing that the NSA was spying on him. He did not display concrete evidence, but he shared that a whistleblower knew the exact contents of his personal texts and emails.

It is no secret that the NSA spies on Americans. Edward Snowden revealed that years ago. However, this appears to be the first public case of the US government openly spying on what they believe to be a political opponent. If true, this has grave potential for the country.

Surely, the NSA denied it. But does that hold any weight? The shady dealings of Democratic politicians has been prevalent for years. It really came to light during Obama‘s term especially with Hillary Clinton. But to spy on a journalist is terrible. It is a slippery slope and one that I hope does not continue.","media, journalist, journalists, free press"

Chinese Communist Party @ 100: How it evolved from Mao to Xi,"China celebrates the centenary of its ruling party on Thursday. The organization has come a long way from revolutionary struggles to becoming arguably the most dominant political organization on earth. Many factors have marked this journey, but the question of leadership is arguably among the more important ones. The Communist Party of China (CPC) is what it is today because it has been shaped thus by three of its top leaders – Mao Zedong, Deng Xioping and Xi Jinping, with the theme of ruthless concentration of power and ideological flexibility running through them.

The party was founded with its First Congress on July 1 in 1921. (Mao was among the 12 or 13 delegates.) After long years of armed struggle, Mao led CPC to victory in a civil war with the other party, Kuomintang, and established the People’s Republic of China on October 1, 1949.  Mao fine-tuned the ideas of Marx and Lenin for a pre-industrial society like China (replacing stress on industrial workers with that on peasantry), and launched a militant version of communism – Maoism. Following Stalin’s advice, he made China a single-party state, making CPP unbeatable. His legacy is mixed: Credited for transforming China from a semi-colonial state to a powerful nation, he is also blamed for making mass repressions an instrument of state policy.

Deng, who emerged as the supreme leader after Mao’s death, brought some order to a nation beset by chaos of ‘Cultural Revolution’. He replaced the Soviet-style planned economy with market-oriented reforms, heralding one of the fastest economic growths ever seen. Communism was out, ‘socialism with Chinese characteristics’ was in; best summed up by Deng citing an old proverb:  “It doesn't matter whether a cat is black or white, if it catches mice it is a good cat.”

Since 2012, Xi, the first top leader born after the Revolution, has followed Deng’s path on economy, which has helped him shape a more assertive foreign policy. In continuity with Mao and Deng, he has centralized power even more. Under him, surveillance and repression have reached truly Orwellian heights.

NationalDoctorsDay","Nanhi si hansi, bholi si khushi
Phoolon si wo baahein bhool gaye
Jab desh ne di aawaz humein

1st of July is celebrated as national doctors day in India in the memory of great physician Dr. Bidhan Chandra Roy. Doctors have been given stature next to god. Has anyone seen god? No, but in the battle with COVID-19 it seems as if god has stepped into the shoes of doctors. The time when we all stayed at home, avoided gatherings, locked our doors so that we don’t catch the virus, these noble souls left everything way too far and worked tirelessly day and night. Countless number of sleepless nights, eating whatever is served so that they are able to work, staying in a fully covered PPE kit for the whole day and imagine we can’t even put on masks for a long period of time, they have done everything for us to breathe peacefully. People say that the  people we serve become our family , if we lose one of our loved ones it takes days to heal while our warriors daily see so many of people they serve; losing their fight against the deadly virus . Their hearts shattered, their minds helpless, their pains unendurable, their energy exhausted and yet stood strong to treat every life with the same energy, making them stronger, comfortable, familiar understanding the responsibilities of so many hopes lingering on them.
Been through days where they couldn’t meet their families for so many months in line seeing their baby crying on face time longing for them and not able to meet them. Approximately 1000+ doctors have lost their lives serving people in covid times. Hey doctor, you have set up a new standard for selfless service that is going to dazzle for decades in the history of mankind. Heartfelt gratitude to the eminent warriors who are relentlessly fighting this battle for our safety. We salute you and applaud you. Thank you for honoring the throne.

The neuroscience behind why your brain may need time to adjust to ‘un-social distancing’,"With COVID-19 vaccines working and restrictions lifting across the country, it’s finally time for those now vaccinated who’ve been hunkered down at home to ditch the sweatpants and reemerge from their Netflix caves. But your brain may not be so eager to dive back into your former social life.

Social distancing measures proved essential for slowing COVID-19’s spread worldwide – preventing upward of an estimated 500 million cases. But, while necessary, 15 months away from each other has taken a toll on people’s mental health.

In a national survey last fall, 36% of adults in the U.S. – including 61% of young adults – reported feeling “serious loneliness” during the pandemic. Statistics like these suggest people would be itching to hit the social scene.

But if the idea of making small talk at a crowded happy hour sounds terrifying to you, you’re not alone. Nearly half of Americans reported feeling uneasy about returning to in-person interaction regardless of vaccination status.

So how can people be so lonely yet so nervous about refilling their social calendars?

Well, the brain is remarkably adaptable. And while we can’t know exactly what our brains have gone through over the last year, neuroscientists like me have some insight into how social isolation and resocialization affect the brain.
Social homeostasis – the need to socialize

Humans have an evolutionarily hardwired need to socialize – though it may not feel like it when deciding between a dinner invite and rewatching “Schitt’s Creek.”

From insects to primates, maintaining social networks is critical for survival in the animal kingdom. Social groups provide mating prospects, cooperative hunting and protection from predators.

But social homeostasis – the right balance of social connections – must be met. Small social networks can’t deliver those benefits, while large ones increase competition for resources and mates. Because of this, human brains developed specialized circuitry to gauge our relationships and make the correct adjustments – much like a social thermostat.

"No, White House has not declared Manmohan Singh as the most ‘honest’ political leader","By Alt News Desk

“In the list of the 50 most honest people in the world released in America, the only person from India Dr Manmohan Singh stood first,” reads a message shared by Congress leader Rajesh Mishra. His tweet drew close to 25,000 likes and over 4,300 retweets.

( Link https://twitter.com/rajesh_inc/status/1409932657664790528?s=19)

The claim is widespread on Twitter.

( Link https://twitter.com/Iamrekhameena/status/1409861415570001923?s=19)

It is massively widespread on Facebook as well where several have questioned the absence of PM Modi’s name.

The most common graphic promoting the claim was made by the pro-Congress page ‘Viral In India’ and has been circulating at least since 2018.

( Link https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10216671958654014&id=1312247943)

Viral In India was run by Abhishek Mishra who has quite a reputation when it comes to disinformation. Mishra is reportedly close to the Congress party.

False claim

The story behind the message goes back to December 2016 when US President Barack Obama hosted the 14th and his final formal State Arrival Ceremony and State Dinner. On the occasion, Chief White House photographer shared glimpses from some of the other state dinners hosted by President Obama over the tenure of his presidency.

The photo series began with the photograph of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his wife Gursharan Kaur being escorted by the Obamas. This image was significant because it was the first official state visit hosted by President Obama after assuming office in 2009. There were no pictures of Narendra Modi in this collection of photographs.

The viral message is based on a half-truth. Yes, a photograph of Manmohan Singh featured prominently in the images shared during a state event by the White House photographer. Yes, Narendra Modi did not feature in the collection of photographs. But the images are not a collection of “honest” world leaders as claimed in the viral message. They were just a selection of behind the scene glimpses of dinners hosted by the Obama administration and nothing more than that.

Moreover, the claim itself should raise doubts because it is absurd for a country to release a list of the most ‘honest’ politicians in the world.",alt news
Lotus Evija : Electric car with horsepower of 2000 bhp,"The Lotus Evija (pronounced eh-VIE'-ya) aims to push the boundaries of modern hypercar technology. While many rivals offer hybrid powertrains, this model commits to being fully electric, and it comes with an ultrafast charging setup. Its exterior design takes cues from race cars built to dominate the track. Best of all, however, is what this car offers from its four electric motors: The Evija delivers almost 2000 horsepower, and Lotus claims this makes it the most powerful production car on the planet. Only 130 models of this leading-edge hypercar will be built, each priced at more than $2 million.

The star of the show is the Evija's muscle-bound electric powertrain. Motivation is provided by a team of four electric motors.

Lotus claims they generate a total output of 1972 horsepower and 1254 lb-ft of torque.

The Evija can reach a top speed of more than 200 mph, and Lotus expects it to sprint to 62 mph in under three seconds.

The Artist Story | Noora Alhashimi,"Noora is a 21-year-old architect and artist based in Bahrain, where she works as an intern at a regional engineering firm. In both her architectural and artistic endeavors, she is interested in the role of time and place in creating narratives, whether on a societal or personal scale.

As an architecture graduate, she has always been interested in chronological movement within a space, the first moments of interaction upon walking through a built environment for the first time, and moreover how that morphs into memorized patterns over time. With art, this was always instinctive, having been brought up in an artistic household. This awareness of time and place manifested subconsciously through the theme of memory, where her work mainly centers on trying to grasp a past feeling to create a collection of all these random anecdotes that capture a lifeline when strung together. Her artistic journey, which is still underway, is to find the patterns and the changes within the culmination of these memories.

""I was particularly moved by your dedication to featuring a diverse cast of artists, yet simultaneously viewing the artist as an artist before any of his/her/their physical attributes; your idea of celebrating differences but not differentiating them. I’ve often felt a duty to represent my culture through my art, and while I naturally include elements of my upbringing within my artworks, I would like them to be not only globally accessible but also understood and felt, beyond the frame of any background. it is refreshing to find a platform that picks up on moments of personal and social identity within the art to show each artist’s unique perspective while granting them all the setting in which these universal themes can coexist."" - Noora","art, painting, artist, arts therapy, arts, art galleries, art collector, artists, paintings, contemporary art, artists on pixstory, digital, artist art, contemporary"

Does Uttarakhand CM's fate really hang in balance or is it just an intense infighting in BJP?,"Uttarakhand Chief Minister Tirath Singh Rawat has to get elected to the state assembly by September 10 to remain on the post, a requirement under norms.

What happens if the by-polls are not held till then given that the Election Commission had to face a lot of flak for holding assembly elections in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Assam and Puducherry amid the onset of the second wave of Covid-19 that left a trail of death and destruction across the country. 

The poll body is apparently mulling over holding by-elections in various states, including West Bengal where Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee too has to get elected to the assembly within six months. 

Now, there are divergent opinions as far as the by-elections in Uttarakhand are concerned. 

According to section 151(A) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, a by-election must be held within six months of a vacancy occurring. 

But a clause provides two exceptions for not holding a by-poll and that is if the remainder of the term in relation to the vacancy is less than a year or if the Election Commission, in consultation with the central government, certifies that it is difficult to hold the by-election within the said period.

This clause was invoked in the case of the Anantnag Lok Sabha constituency following People's Democratic Party (PDP) leader Mehbooba Mufti resignation from the Lower House after taking oath as Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister in 2016. The by-poll to the Lok Sabha seat was not held till the end of the term in 2019.

The term of the current Uttarakhand assembly ends on March 23, 2022 and, therefore, the above mentioned clause can be invoked in Rawat's case also. 

But there are voices within the BJP that insist on having an elected Chief Minister, arguing that if the by-elections are not held then there should be a change of guard in the state. 

The central leadership has now summoned Rawat to Delhi for a discussion. 

Meanwhile, the AAP fielded retired Colonel Ajay Kothiyal to fight Gangotri bypolls against Rawat, claiming the outcome will change the political picture in Uttarakhand.","Politics, uttarakhand, chief minister, election commission, tirath singh rawat, bypolls"

DoctorsDay - Olympian Heena Sidhu: A dental surgeon who revolutionized Indian pistol shooting,"Olympian Heena Sidhu: A dental surgeon who revolutionized Indian pistol shooting

A Bachelor of Dental Surgery, Heena Sidhu became the country’s first pistol shooter to achieve world number one ranking in the 10m air pistol category on April 7, 2014. In the same year, she also had a world record in the 10m air pistol event. A year before, she became the first Indian pistol shooter to clinch a gold in the World Cup.  

The accomplishments in the world arena made the Punjab shooter a new poster girl of the Indian shooting.

Balancing academics and sports was not an easy task for Heena. At times because of her shooting commitment, she had to make compromises on the academic front. But eventually, she got success on both the fronts. 

During the 2010 Asian Games held in Guangzhou in China, Heena had her BDS third-year dentistry exams. The exams were colliding with the date of her event in Guangzhou. The exams were staring from November 11 and the event (10m Air Pistol) was on November 14.

Leaving the exams would stretch her BDS degree by a semester. So, she requested her college Ganga Sagar Medical College for Dental Studies to further request the university to postpone the exams for her. But the university refused to entertain the request.

Finally some official in the shooting fraternity gave her a 1987 Notification of Human Resource Development Ministry stating that the school, college or university has to accommodate the student if his/her examinations dates were clashing with some national or international tournaments. And in that case its mandatory to postpone or pre-pone the exams. Eventually, after producing the notification, the university postponed the exams.

Heena along with Anu Raj Singh and Sonia Rai won 10m Air Pistol team silver in the Asian Games. After returning from the games she was back with the books and gave the exams in December.

On earlier occasion also Heena had to skip her final exams because of her shooting commitment.

""Shooting is my passion but at the same time I want to be a doctor,"" Heena had said during the 2010 Asian Games. 
She represented India in the 2012 London and 2016 Rio Olympics.","olympics, doctor, shooting, heena sidhu, dental surgeon, pistol shooting, bds"

Indian-origin American Abhimanyu Mishra  youngest-ever chess Grandmaster,"After months of uncertainty induced by the pandemic, together with a cash-crunch travelling around the world in these difficult times, Indian-origin American Abhimanyu Mishra has become the youngest-ever chess Grandmaster in the world.

At 12 years, four months and 25 days, he obliterated the long-standing record held by Sergey Karjakin, who was 12 years and seven months old when he attained the title. Three years ago, India’s R Praggnanandhaa had almost surpassed him, but missed the opportunity by a whisker. As did many assaults on the 19-year-old record until Abhimanyu’s moment.

But Abhimanyu, after becoming the world’s youngest International Master last year, chased his dream and achieved the feat at the Vezerkepzo GM Mix in Budapest, a tournament organised just to give him one final shot at the title, as several chess players stayed back due to travel restrictions. Abhimanyu has been in the Hungarian capital since April, in pursuit of the record. He had attained the first and second GM norms in April and May, but the third had seemed elusive with time catching up and fewer tournaments in the horizon. He had to wait till mid-July for another shot at the record, but for this tournament.",chess
How a Soviet miner from the 1930s helped create today’s intense corporate workplace culture,"One summer night in August, 1935, a young Soviet miner named Alexei Stakhanov managed to extract 102 tonnes of coal in a single shift. This was nothing short of extraordinary (according to Soviet planning, the official average for a single shift was seven tonnes).

Stakhanov shattered this norm by a staggering 1,400%. But the sheer quantity involved was not the whole story. It was Stakhanov’s achievement as an individual that became the most meaningful aspect of this episode. And the work ethic he embodied then – which spread all over the USSR – has been invoked by managers in the west ever since.

Stakhanov’s personal striving, commitment, potential and passion led to the emergence of a new ideal figure in the imagination of Stalin’s Communist Party. He even made the cover of Time magazine in 1935 as the figurehead of a new workers movement dedicated to increasing production. Stakhanov became the embodiment of a new human type and the beginning of a new social and political trend known as “Stakhanovism”.

That trend still holds sway in the workplaces of today – what are human resources, after all? Management language is replete with the same rhetoric used in the 1930s by the Communist Party. It could even be argued that the atmosphere of Stakhanovite enthusiasm is even more intense today than it was in Soviet Russia. It thrives in the jargon of Human Resource Management (HRM), as its constant calls to express our passion, individual creativity, innovation and talents echo down through management structures.

But all this “positive” talk comes at a price. For over two decades, our research has charted the evolution of managerialism, HRM, employability and performance management systems, all the way through to the cultures they create. We have shown how it leaves employees with a permanent sense of never feeling good enough and the nagging worry that someone else (probably right next to us) is always performing so much better.

He was rushed to the burns ward of Safdarjung Hospital where he fought a brave battle for his life and, fortuitously, survived. Goswami became the face of the agitation against the Mandal Commission, and his action sparked a series of self-immolation bids by other upper-caste college students, who strongly disputed the commission’s recommendations as they found them to be unjust and biased against the deserving.

Before grade separators and an interchange came up at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) intersection, where Ring Road and Sri Aurobindo Marg cross each other, it was not only one of the busiest intersections in Delhi, but perhaps in the country. It was the meeting point of the north–south traffic corridor with the east–west corridor, with thousands of vehicles plying across it every minute. Since Rajeev Goswami was fighting for his life in the nearby Safdarjung Hospital, the agitating students of Delhi decided to make the AIIMS crossing the base of their revolt against the government. They squatted at the intersection in the thousands, blocking traffic and bringing the city to a near halt. The blockade was, in media circles, compared to the Tiananmen Square protests of mid-1989 in Beijing, the memories of which were fresh in everyone’s mind.

The formidable student movement against job reservations and the creation of OBCs witnessed 200 self- immolation attempts. Sadly, sixty-two students succumbed to their burns. Almost every opposition party supported the agitation, some more overtly than others, but they never stated so in explicit terms. To support the agitation overtly meant opposing reservations approved for OBCs, which in turn would have meant alienating 51 per cent of the voters. Therefore, the opposition leaders restricted themselves to criticizing police action and sympathizing with the families of those students who had immolated themselves.

A few days later, while controlling unlawful crowds near INA market (again in south district), I ordered my boys to resort to lathi charge and tear-gas the mob if the situation called for it. The mob refused to disperse and resorted to large- scale arson and vandalism.

7. khaki files – Devils’s Advocate : What was the mandal commission and what it meant,"Devil’s Advocate continues ………….

The Mandal Commission or the Socially Backward Classes Commission was established on 1 January 1979 by the Janata Party government under Prime Minister Charan Singh. Its aim was to identify the ‘socially or economically backward classes’ of India. B.P. Mandal, an Indian parliamentarian, headed the commission to consider the question of reservation for such categories of people who had suffered for centuries on account of caste discrimination. By using eleven social, economic and educational indicators to determine backwardness, the commission in 1980 submitted its report recommending that a new category of the Indian population should be identified, namely, Other Backward Classes (OBC), which comprised 51 per cent of India’s population. The commission further recommended that 27 per cent of jobs under the Central government and public sector undertakings should be reserved for OBCs, thereby making the total percentage of reservations a whopping 49 per cent of government jobs.

The commission’s recommendations were pending implementation for about seven years when in August 1990 the Janata Dal government led by V.P. Singh declared its intent to implement them.

The criticism and reaction to the proposed implementation were sharp and severe. Student protests were particularly serious and widespread. The protests started in Delhi  University and spread all over the country. At the time I was serving as deputy commissioner of police, south district, in Delhi. And it so happened that the area under my jurisdiction became the epicentre of these protests.

On 19 September 1990, students of Deshbandhu College and Bhagat Singh College—both under my jurisdiction— were protesting by throwing brickbats at public transport and blocking traffic. I reached the spot with police reserves and tried to control the mob. In our presence, Rajeev Goswami, a student of Deshbandhu College, tried to commit self- immolation in protest against the government’s intent to implement the Mandal Commission’s recommendations. My men managed to save him by quickly putting a blanket over him.

How Black writers and journalists have wielded punctuation in their activism,"Using punctuation and capitalization as a form of protest doesn’t exactly scream radicalism.

But in debates over racial justice, punctuation can carry a lot of weight.

During the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020, mainstream news organizations grappled with whether to capitalize the first letter of “black” when referring to Black people. Of course, writing “Black” was already common practice in activist circles. Eventually The Associated Press, The New York Times, USA Today and many other outlets declared that they, too, would capitalize that first letter.

It turns out the push to capitalize “black” is only the most recent way Black writers and activists have pushed back against entrenched power through ostensibly bland elements of writing.

As I discuss in my recent book, “Jim Crow Networks: African American Periodical Cultures,” Black activism in the media can take a variety of forms – some more subtle than others.

Seemingly unimportant elements of writing have long been adapted as tools of Black activism. Much like the recent drive to capitalize “black,” activists have deployed punctuation to question the legitimacy of confessions, criticize justifications made for lynchings and highlight the undervaluing of Black expertise and knowledge.

The power of punctuation

Punctuation was developed in the 3rd century B.C. to visually separate sentences and improve comprehension. But punctuation can do more than clarify. It can extend, contradict and play with meaning.

Think of the difference between ending a sentence with an exclamation point and with an ellipsis, or the way emoticons made of repurposed punctuation can be used to denote sarcasm or add playfulness and emotion.

This makes it a useful tool for activists who seek to upend dominant narratives.

Quotation marks convey suspicion

A push to capitalize has actually happened before.

In the 1920s, influential Black intellectual W.E.B. Du Bois wrote to The New York Times and Encyclopedia Britannica to argue that the word “negro” ought to have its first letter capitalized.

A decade later, to counter racism in the white press, the Black press used quotation marks when reporting on the case of a young man named Robert Nixon, who was convicted of murder.

Legitimizing Doctor Doctor jokes with my Best Friend 🩺🩹💊,"He broke my heart because his only focus in life was clearing his NEET exams. A year and more of house arrest and disappointments,  and finally on his second attempt getting into a  medical college, well it has been quite a phenomenal journey 

Becoming a Doctor was not easy, I totally remember him calling me over the span of four and half years and crying over calls. But he did it. 

Soon after getting his degree, he rushed back to the hospital for his internship and training in the hospital. 

Because of the lack of medical staff and emergency situation in the country, hospitals are assigning fresh graduates and final year students into Covid Wards. I asked Aakash, wasn't he scared to go inside a room full of patients suffering from Covid? He told me, what I know and am aware of is that I am the safest inside that ward wearing a PPE kit, because everyone inside I know are patients, outside I am not sure how many people are infected. 

On his first day of duty in the Covid Ward, he felt devastated as he saw 4 people dying in front of his eyes. He mentioned that hearing about people dying on the news is altogether a different feeling than seeing people dying in front of your eyes. By the third or fourth day of his duty, he started feeling numb.

He feels there should be a law against the people who attack the Doctors, as they're putting their life at risk and doing their job without any breaks during these tough times. 

He mentions that, we Doctors study 19 subjects to save lives, but I think we should study 20 subjects instead, one more to learn how can we save our lives too, and not get attacked or thrashed for just doing our job. 

Although Aakash was influenced by his elder brother, and thus wanted to become a Doctor. But now seeing the present situation and circumstances he feels proud to be part of the Doctors community, and feels responsible towards saving as many lives as he can. ","Health, covid 19, medical science, covid warriors, stories, friendship, essentials, frontline healthcare workers, medical workers, best friends, doctors' day, health worker, mbbs"
Happy National Doctor's Day,"""A doctor is bestowed with the eye to see and treat weakness in mankind. He is the one who can give us hope when we are in doom"". 
Today is National Doctor's Day. Well, the importance of doctors can't be defined in one word or a quote but a day devoted to them is just to recognize their value in our lives. This Corona pandemic has shown us how valuable they are for society.  We always want to not to get any disease and so not to go to meet doctors. However, we mostly get to meet them for numerous reasons. In those tough days, Doctor's advice can heal most of your pain. They try to treat patients with love and care. But this year's CoronaVirus became a hazard for everyone. The doctors who were treating the patients and prayed for their recovery, even they failed many times. They tried their best to protect people, did 24 hours duty, kept their eyes open for 24*7 so that no single person could die at their hospital. After this much hard work also, we heard the news that many doctors couldn't battle with their own lives. Although we don't know the exact numbers, yet there are many doctors who couldn't survive. My sincere last respect to them and more power to their families. Their sacrifice should not go in waste. Therefore we named them ""Covid Warriors"".  The world needs more courageous, sincere and hardworking warriors, just like doctors.
To tribute the Covid Warriors and to recognize their efforts in this survival battle our Prime Minister announced on his ""Mann ki Baat"" episode to celebrate 1st of July as National Doctor's Day. On this National Doctor's Day let's give our appreciative words to them. 
Thank you doctors for your constant help & support during these tough times.","pixstory, doctor, warrior, doctor's day"

On Doctor day- a note of gratitude from pixstory,"The story of pixstory is peculiar. We were conceiving it around the same time coronavirus /Covid 19 
was mutating, incubating, even infecting some people not very far from the country we live in. 
When we started our pixstory journey, one of our first meeting was to discuss Covid 19- having covered both  swine flu and SARS, I wasn’t sure which way we are going. As the virus spread its wings, we yearned to make some difference in the lives of people who were fighting not just the novel disease but also loneliness and solitude . 
As we started our journey, some great minds and eminent doctors guided us at each step-extended their support and believed in pixstory as an endeavour to present and promote facts and fact based news. 
As we launched pixstory, some of these doctors became our faces for amplifying authentic information. They associated with us- we did stories on important issues and they helped us understand the disease, our helplines helped clarify doubts, some young doctors took time out from their hectic schedules to share their stories with us. For us at pixstory they are our stars. 
As July 1 marks Doctors’ day in India, we want  to express our gratitude,  recognise and celebrate the contribution of our doctors in the community, in the country,in our lives and also in pixstory. Doctors have always been seen as Gods particularly in cultures like ours. Their role  has become even more crucial during the present day as the world is battling the Covid-19 pandemic. Living their lives inside the PPE suits in sultry weather, the doctors and medical workers are at the fore front of this fight. 
The difference made by doctors in our individual lives is hard to quantify.  We don’t have words enough to express gratitude for the kindness, the compassion, the hardships they faced , even the stigma that came with saving our lives. Let’s celebrate these saviours today with our notes of gratitude, let’s hear their stories, let the day be about them .","Health, covid 19, pixstory, doctors"
Mourning On The Clock: Processing Grief In Doctor-Patient Relationships,"This past year, I’ve been thinking about the time I interviewed medical students from the University of Washington about how they process grief doctor-patient relationships.

Here are some excerpts from my article (from 2019) in The Daily, UW’s student-run college newspaper —

Kelly MacWhorter’s first personal experience with grief occurred during her inpatient training at Harborview Medical Center. After her patient died, she didn’t get an opportunity to express herself and was expected to continue working. When MacWhorter broke down during her shift, she realized that she was ill-equipped to handle grief’s impact on her ability to work.

After encountering similar experiences, MacWhorter tried counseling but ended up crying the whole time — the exhaustion of working 20-hour shifts prevented her from confronting her overwhelming emotions that had repeatedly been suppressed.

Now, as a fourth-year medical student at the UW School of Medicine (UWSOM), MacWhorter is working with a palliative care doctor on creating a five-page handout that will act as a toolkit for future medical students dealing with grief while working.

“We've talked about mental health, and we had a physician suicide awareness day and reflected on that,” MacWhorter said. “But we never really answered the question of ‘how’ — how do we take care of ourselves? How do we seek out help? How do we deal with grief personally when we're faced with it?”

When Carol Kummet, a palliative care social worker, came to the UW Medical Center in 2010, everybody was talking about Elisabeth Kübler-Ross’ five stages of grief. But that is now considered to be outdated information.

Kummet, who has extensive experience in bereavement services, explained that updated theories such as J. William Worden’s four tasks of mourning focus on “actual doing” for healthy processing of grief.

“The first [task] is to stop and acknowledge the losses, changes, challenges, and deaths that you've experienced,” Kummet said. Once the loss is acknowledged, “you're going to have some pain associated with that: tears, anger, yearning, depression, sorrow, irritability. But William Worden says the second task is to actually sit with the pain and experience it.”

Another data published by The World Bank suggests that there is less than one doctors for every 1000 people in India.

"To make agriculture more climate-friendly, carbon farming needs clear rules","As the effects of climate change intensify and paths for limiting global warming narrow, politicians, media and environmental advocates have rallied behind “carbon farming” as a mutually beneficial strategy for society, the environment and farmers.

Agriculture covers more than half of Earth’s terrestrial surface and contributes roughly one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions. Paying farmers to restore carbon-depleted soils offers a tantalizing opportunity for a natural climate solution that could help nations to meet their commitments under the international Paris climate agreement to stabilize global warming below 2 degrees Celsius.

An international initiative called “4 per 1000,” launched at the 2015 Paris climate conference, showed that increasing soil carbon worldwide by just 0.4% yearly could offset that year’s new growth in carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel emissions.

Research shows that farmers and ranchers can also make their operations more resilient to increasingly variable weather by adopting practices that promote soil carbon sequestration. This prospect led us to establish a center at Colorado State University that develops and implements soil-based solutions to climate change.

While many policy options exist to reduce emissions from agricuture, carbon farming has sparked bipartisan U.S. legislation and attracted investors’ attention. Critics question its true potential, however. Some environment and justice advocacy groups argue that paying farmers won’t do much to increase soil carbon, and could allow polluting industries such as manufacturing to avoid necessary emission reductions by buying soil carbon credits from farmers instead.

Given the momentum behind carbon farming as a climate change mitigation strategy, we believe now is the time to establish clear standards that ensure that only real net changes in carbon receive financial rewards.

Carbon farming basics

As plants grow, they pull carbon from the atmosphere, and soil soaks it up and stores it. The amount of carbon stored varies significantly across soil type and climate.

Traditional farming methods that sequester carbon have existed for millennia. For example, minimizing soil disturbance through no-till farming reduces carbon loss to the atmosphere. Diversifying crops and planting legumes, perennials and cover crops returns more carbon to the soil, and sustains soil microbes that play key roles in carbon storage.

100th anniversary of China’s Communist Party today,"China will celebrate the 100th anniversary of the founding of its Communist Party on Thursday. Beijing has put up decorations and is portraying this symbolic political moment as a triumph.

The event caps a year in which Beijing has come under criticism for its refusal to allow W.H.O. investigators much access to delve into the origins of the coronavirus, its crackdowns on Hong Kong and Xinjiang, and its hostility toward Taiwan.

The party’s longevity has baffled its critics, and as The Economist reports, no other dictatorship has transformed so much — from a famine crisis in the Mao Zedong era to the world’s second-largest economy. Economic growth and a sharp decline in rural poverty in many places have won the hearts of many citizens more than ideology.

But there are many challenges ahead to maintain the economic benefits that have kept young Chinese people optimistic about the future. Falling birthrates are plaguing the nation, and officials have made it a priority to get families growing. This year, the party moved from a two-child policy (which replaced the infamous one-child policy in 2016) to a three-child policy, but young people are not biting. Income inequality, a lack of child care options and vast economic divides present a long-term problem for the party in this area.

For this week’s event, officials are rewriting parts of history and clamping down on criticism in order to glorify the party’s contributions to Chinese citizens. (There is even a special hotline to report “historical nihilists.”) But party members wonder if Xi Jinping is doing enough to move the country forward, The Financial Times reports. Many insiders criticize Xi as having done away with the checks and balances put in place under Deng Xiaoping that helped the party avoid embarrassing mistakes and left the economy to flourish.

Podcast Recommendation: Old Gods of Appalachia,"Last autumn, I got pretty homesick. I was about a month into grad school, living in a new country, and really missing home. I grew up in the DC suburbs, but my family took lots of drives into the Appalachian mountains, I did summer camp there, and the rolling green hills have always been beautiful to me. 

So when I heard about a podcast that combined folklore, history, and horror set in an alternate Appalachia, I knew that was for me. Old Gods of Appalachia is a series of interweaving stories about the settlers, coal miners, and witches of Appalachia. You can listen to some episodes as standalones, but when listened to in the series you can see how they all connect. 

The voice acting, sound design, and storylines are all fantastic. It’s written, produced, and acted by entirely creators with roots in Appalachia, and you can feel the love they have for the area and it’s history.

I’m what one might describe as a baby when it comes to horror (Jump scares get me!) but I also love the creepy, unsettled feeling a good scary story can give you. Because Old Gods is a podcast, there are no real jump scares, and you can listen in broad daylight if you need to. It’s not for the faint of heart, but if you love folklore and history, and don’t mind feeling like someone might be watching you, I can’t recommend enough. 

I’ve only finished the first season and the first mid season arc, but my favorites are episodes 0.5 “The Witch Queen” - which immediately sold me on the series - and 7 “Afterbirth”.

"China is building more than 100 new missile silos in its western desert, analysts say","China has begun construction of what independent experts say are more than 100 new silos for intercontinental ballistic missiles in a desert near the northwestern city of Yumen, a building spree that could a signal a major expansion of Beijing’s nuclear capabilities.
Commercial satellite images obtained by researchers at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies in Monterey, Calif., show work underway at scores of sites across a grid covering hundreds of square miles of arid terrain in China’s Gansu province. The 119 nearly identical construction sites contain features that mirror those seen at existing launch facilities for China’s arsenal of nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles.
The acquisition of more than 100 new missile silos, if completed, would represent a historic shift for China, a country that is believed to possess a relatively modest stockpile of between 250 and 350 nuclear weapons. The actual number of new missiles intended for those silos is unknown but could be much smaller. China has deployed decoy silos in the past.
During the Cold War, the United States developed a plan to move its ICBMs across a matrix of silos in a kind of nuclear shell game, to ensure that Soviet war planners could never know exactly where the missiles were at any given time.
The construction boom suggests a major effort to bolster the credibility of China’s nuclear deterrent, said researcher Jeffrey Lewis, an expert on China’s nuclear arsenal and part of a team that analyzed the suspicious sites, first spotted by colleague Decker Eveleth as he scoured photos taken by commercial satellites over northwestern China. Lewis described the scale of the building spree as “incredible.”

Bill Cosby released from prison after sexual assault conviction vacated by Pennsylvania SC,"Bill Cosby was released from prison Wednesday after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court announced his sexual-assault conviction had been overturned. The entertainer served more than two years after being convicted of sexual assault in one of the most high-profile trials of the MeToo era.
Cosby, 83, was freed as a result of what the court ruled was a violation of his rights in his criminal trial.
“We always believed that this is how the case was going to end up,” said Brian W. Perry, one of Cosby’s appeals lawyers. “We’re ecstatic with the supreme court’s decision today.”
In an opinion written by Justice David Wecht, the court said a prosecutor involved in investigating Cosby, Montgomery County (Pa.) District Attorney Bruce Castor, induced Cosby into making incriminating comments in a civil case by promising him that his statements wouldn’t be used in a parallel criminal case. Later, a different prosecutor, District Attorney Kevin Steele, used those comments to prosecute him — which the appeals court ruled was a violation of Cosby’s Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination. The court said Steele was obligated to stand by his predecessor’s promise not to charge Cosby.
The Pennsylvania Department of Corrections announced that Cosby was released from SCI Phoenix in Collegeville, Pa., shortly before 2:30 p.m. He managed to leave the prison quietly, apparently without being photographed by the journalists who rushed to the scene. Perry said Cosby was picked up by his spokesman, Andrew Wyatt, and driven to his home in Cheltenham, Pa., where he met with his lawyers, including Perry and Jennifer Bonjean. Perry described his client as “overwhelmed.”
“I’ve been dealing with Mr. Cosby on a regular basis for over two years, and he has never been anything but positive,” he said. “He always believed this would be the outcome.”
The ruling raises questions about how much one prosecutor is obligated to the decisions made by their predecessor, according to one legal expert.
“The wrinkle in all this is the dispute about whether the agreement between the [first] prosecutor and Cosby’s lawyers is binding on the second prosecutor,” said Carissa Byrne Hessick, a law professor at the University of North Carolina.

Time to Face the Music for Trump- Probe Into His Business Dealings Take A Dramatic Turn,"Donald Trump's company and his longtime finance chief are expected to be charged Thursday with tax-related crimes stemming from a New York investigation into the former president's business dealings, people familiar with the matter told The Associated Press. The charges against the Trump Organization and the company's chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, appear to involve non-monetary benefits the company gave to top executives, possibly including use of apartments, cars and school tuition.

The charges against Weisselberg and the Trump Organization would be first criminal cases to arise from the two-year probe led by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr, a Democrat who leaves office at the end of the year.

Prosecutors have been scrutinizing Trump's tax records, subpoenaing documents and interviewing witnesses, including Trump insiders and company executives.

A grand jury was recently empaneled to weigh evidence and New York Attorney General Letitia James said she was assigning two of her lawyers to work with Vance on the criminal probe while she continues a civil investigation of Trump.

Will South Africa's third COVID wave prove to be its worst yet?,"President of South Africa Cyril Ramaphosa drew parallels with a storm when talking about the third wave that has forced the country into a lockdown. It is ""gathering in strength and force,"" he told his country on Sunday. [https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/06/27/world/covid-vaccine-coronavirus-mask]

South Africa is caught in a wave that is sweeping across Africa. And it's a wave that many experts had predicted looking at the lax response of the country in tackling the crisis.

For instance, only around 4.5 percent of the country's 60 million people have received a least one dose so far. South Africa accounts for about 40 percent of all Covid-19 deaths in Africa. It has recorded a little over 60,038 cases of death, although the numbers could be higher as there are said to be many unreported deaths.

According to the latest figures, the country has recorded over 19,500 new Covid-19 cases and 380 deaths in 24 hours. [https://www.news24.com/news24/southafrica/news/covid-19-sa-records-13-347-new-cases-as-death-toll-climbs-by-226-20210630]

This wave could take even a deadlier form than the two previous waves as it is being driven by the highly infectious Delta variant of the virus. Most of the new cases detected in the country belong to this virus.

With the third wave raging, the South African government has brought in new restrictions that include curfew hours and banning all alcohol sales and gatherings. The South African government has been accused of being lax in implementing its own rules to contain the spread.

It is in the country's Gauteng province, where the most people live, where it has taken a severe form. Here Covid patients are forced to spend hours waiting for hospital beds. Gauteng alone accounts for around 70 percent of the country's total cases.

The cases could go out of control in other parts of the country and hospitals could run out of beds and this could get even more serious if new cases cannot be brought down. And hence the South African president is pressing the panic button.

Dr B C Roy died on the same date he was born:  June 1; His  life in 12 points!,"1. He was the “first medical consultant in the subcontinent of India, who towered over his contemporaries in several fields”.
2. Paying a tribute to Dr Roy on his death, British medical journal 
 said, “… at his professional zenith he may have had the largest consulting practice in the world, news of his visit to a city or even railway station bringing forth hordes of would-be patients.”

3. Dr Roy played an instrumental role in the creation of two prestigious medical institutions in the country — the Indian Medical Association in 1928 and the Medical Council of India, of which he was the first president, between 1939 and 1945. 

4. He also helped start the Indian Institute of Mental Health, the Infectious Disease Hospital and Kolkata’s first-ever postgraduate medical college.
5.  He was Born on 1 July, 1882 in Bihar’s Patna, he studied mathematics at Patna College and then medicine at Calcutta Medical College. 

6. He was in school when the partition of Bengal took place. It took Roy almost 30 meetings with the dean to later gain admission into St Bartholomew’s Hospital in London, because the dean wasn’t keen to admit him.

7. After his post graduation in 1911, he went on to become a Member of the Royal College of Physicians (MRCP) and a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons (FRCS).

8. On returning from London, Roy became active in politics, even succeeding Subhas Chandra Bose in 1931 as Mayor of Calcutta. 

9. He joined Mahatma Gandhi’s Civil Disobedience movement, soon becoming his friend and personal physician. In May 1933, when Gandhi was undertaking a 21-day fast in Parnakutivin, Poona (now Pune), Roy was by his side and taking care of him.

10. After independence, Roy became Governor of Uttar Pradesh and a year later, in 1948, the second Chief Minister of West Bengal. He served until his death on 1 July 1962, dying on the same date on which he was born.

11. A year before his death, Roy was honoured with the Bharat Ratna. 

12. After his passing, his house was gifted to the public for running a nursing home. ","doctors, doctor's day, medical professionals, dr b c roy"
Why July 1 observed as  national doctor's day in India?,"The day was first observed in 1991 in honour of the former Bengal’s Chief Minister Dr BC Roy to recognise his contribution to serving humanity. Dr Roy was a great doctor who made an enormous contribution to the medical field. He was born on July 1, 1882, and died on a similar date in 1962.

He was also conferred with the honour of Bharat Ratna, on February 4, 1961. He played a significant role in establishing medical institutions like Jadavpur T.B. Hospital, Chittaranjan Seva Sadan, Kamala Nehru Memorial Hospital, Victoria Institution (college), Chittaranjan Cancer Hospital and the Chittaranjan Seva Sadan for women and children. He was also called the first medical consultant in the subcontinent of India who towered over his contemporaries in several fields by British Medical journal.",doctors' day

Is the overheated U.S. housing market finally cracking?,"U.S. home prices jumped in April by the most in more than fifteen years as a pandemic-fueled buying led to huge demand and the properties went down to historic lows. It had led to experts predicting that the housing market could be overheating.

The first signs of overheating are already there with home prices appreciating so much that the mortgage demand has fallen for the first time in almost a year and a half. Affordability is a big question mark now, especially with the low end of the market, which saw the maximum demand ever since the pandemic hit the U.S. Builders have also raised prices in recent months with the rise in and put house hunters on waiting lists.

According to experts, house hunters are increasingly getting priced out with homeownership now out of reach for most people in more than 4 in 10 counties across the U.S. [https://www.cbsnews.com/news/housing-real-estate-home-buying-affordability/]

Whether the recent dip in demand is blip or the prices will continue to soar will only be known with a few months of data. Even last year, experts had predicted a huge fall in prices of homes with the pandemic resulting in job losses. Still, just the opposite happened with people looking for bigger homes to accommodate working from home, while the well-to-do started looking for homes away from cities to escape the virus. [https://edition.cnn.com/2021/05/13/business/global-real-estate-prices/index.html]

The reason for the dip in demand could also be because after mortgage rates being at historical lows encouraging buyers, they are on the rise with the Fed tightening the monetary policy and the mortgage rates becoming higher.

"covidwarriors From Remdesivir to other critical medicines, Tejas managed to arrange all.","Tejas Shelar is one of the volunteers at India Cares. He has been working with India cares since the first lockdown commenced. His work involved taking care of all the critical medicine request, from Remdesivir to  Liposomal Amphotericin B, he could manage to arrange all.
""I used to take critical medicines request, every kind of medicine even if it had to be imported from outside the country"" he said.
Tejas is well versed with the technical procedure and offical channel for procuring such critical medicines.
He made  sure people do not get deceived and buy the medicines from the black market. 
He tells that there's a offical procedure for getting these medicines and most people in our country do not know about it."" I used to speak to the hospital admin directly or with  the chief medical officer who is present in the district or the collector office, I made sure the procedure is followed properly.""
Tejas tells that the most arduous was to make people understand, ""Mostly people needed these medicines when they were on death bed and it became quite challenging to make them understand the procedure and also to tell them that there's an alternative available if that medicine couldn't be procured, they used to get panic"", he said.
Apart from medicine request, many other critical cases were handled through contacts and coordination.
He tells""I remember a case where we helped a guy to transfer dead body from Salem in Tamilnadu to Bhadrak in Odisha, one of the brothers met with an accident and it was the time of lockdown during 2020, they were not able to get the postmortem done and it was a matter of transporting a dead body during lockdown between three states, it was quite challenging but finally we arranged a ambulance for them, and body reached Bhadrak. It was such a relief to help these people, and the guy is still in touch"".
Having studied and known alot about the disease Tejas says that doesn't seem to be a dread to him."" I took the necessary precautions and I was not scared of getting infected"".","covid 19, covid warriors"
Critical race theory: What it is and what it isn’t,"U.S. Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana sent a letter to fellow Republicans on June 24, 2021, stating: “As Republicans, we reject the racial essentialism that critical race theory teaches … that our institutions are racist and need to be destroyed from the ground up.”

Kimberlé Crenshaw, a law professor and central figure in the development of critical race theory, said in a recent interview that critical race theory “just says, let’s pay attention to what has happened in this country, and how what has happened in this country is continuing to create differential outcomes. … Critical Race Theory … is more patriotic than those who are opposed to it because … we believe in the promises of equality. And we know we can’t get there if we can’t confront and talk honestly about inequality.”

Rep. Banks’ account is demonstrably false and typical of many people publicly declaring their opposition to critical race theory. Crenshaw’s characterization, while true, does not detail its main features. So what is critical race theory and what brought it into existence?

The development of critical race theory by legal scholars such as Derrick Bell and Crenshaw was largely a response to the slow legal progress and setbacks faced by African Americans from the end of the Civil War, in 1865, through the end of the civil rights era, in 1968. To understand critical race theory, you need to first understand the history of African American rights in the U.S.

The history

After 304 years of enslavement, then-former slaves gained equal protection under the law with passage of the 14th Amendment in 1868. The 15th Amendment, in 1870, guaranteed voting rights for men regardless of race or “previous condition of servitude.”

Between 1866 and 1877 – the period historians call “Radical Reconstruction” – African Americans began businesses, became involved in local governance and law enforcement and were elected to Congress.

"12. Dial D for Don: Gifts from the Gulf- Is Farhan Malik, Aftab Ansari in disguise?","“Gifts from the Gulf” continues…

Rajeev quickly ascertained the calling number from Kolkata telephone exchange. It was the same number from which the Burman family had received ransom calls after Burman’s kidnapping. Then the caller had disclosed his identity as Aftab Ansari. It was more than certain that Farhan Malik was none other than Aftab Ansari. The mobile number from which Kolkata numbers had been called was passed on to me and I, in turn, shared it with K.C. Singh, our Ambassador in Abu Dhabi (U.A.E.). 

During the course of the day, I suggested to my Director that the matter ought to be brought to the notice of the highest office in the government. The man behind the Santalpur arms trafficking case was also the mastermind of the attack on the American Centre in Kolkata. It was time we involved the Americans in getting Aftab Ansari nabbed in Dubai. They might respond positively as one of their own overseas facilities had come under attack. I suggested to the Director that he should meet the Prime Minister and request him to use his good offices to get a message conveyed to the US authorities. The Director took my suggestion and sought an appointment with the Prime Minister on an urgent basis.

The same evening Director Sharma called me on my mobile at about 8 pm, soon after I returned home from work. He said he had met the PM and briefed him. PM Vajpayee had immediately summoned his Principal Secretary Brajesh Mishra and asked him to get the Americans in the loop.

"Football linked to 2,000 Scottish Covid cases","Nearly 2,000 Covid cases in Scotland have been linked to people watching Euro 2020 football matches.

Public Health Scotland said two thirds of the 1,991 cases were people who travelled to London for Scotland's game with England on 18 June.
This included 397 fans who were inside Wembley for the match.
A relatively small number of cases reported attending the Fanzone in Glasgow, or Scotland's two home matches at Hampden.

It would be interesting to see the spike in cases after yesterday’s game at Wembley, where 40,000 were at attendance. 

The very first outbreak in Italy last year was linked to a soccer match at the san Siro stadium.

Checking in with the Ladies,"It’s been a rough few weeks. Britney’s conservatorship is making headlines and the WHO recommendation that child-bearing-aged women should “be prevented” from drinking alcohol is still ringing in our ears. I wish I could say that weeks like this are unusual, but they’re not. Several times a year, women are reminded that someone is always trying to control their bodies, and no one seems to be doing that much about it. Do you remember the time that the London Police violently broke up Sarah Everard’s vigil? Right after International Women’s Day? Because I do.
 
Even the news that IVF has been legalized for lesbians in France is kind of a double-edged victory. On the one hand, it’s great that queer French women now have that option! On the other hand, it’s 2021. Shouldn’t we all have been happily utilizing our reproductive rights for decades by now?  
 
I hope Britney wins. I hope every French lesbian who wants a baby gets one. I hope people stop trying to control women’s bodies. I hope we stop judging a woman’s intelligence and self-respect based on what she’s wearing. I hope we all start better understanding and promoting intersectional feminism so we can advocate more effectively for each other.
 
And most of all, I hope that in ten years women aren’t still writing some version of this post.

What is happening at the US Border?,"US border patrol agents are arresting on average 6,300 illegal immigrants every single day. To be clear, these apprehensions are happening as they are trying to illegally enter the country from the southern border. So much for a crisis under control.

Since October, more than 1 million people have been arrested trying to enter the border illegally. Fortunately our law-enforcement has kept the border on lockdown. How many people crept through the cracks though? Likely we will never know.

DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, when asked about the “cruelty“ of arresting those at the border, said it was because of public health orders. To put it another way, it is because of the risk of Covid. He assured reporters that once the public health emergency was over the apprehensions would stop. Does that mean the Biden administration is intent on allowing millions of illegal immigrants to storm the country? It seems so.","biden, biden admin, border patrol"
World Social Media Day- Which one do you use the most?,"                        World Social Media day was first celebrated by Mashable on 30 June 2010 to put an emphasis on the impact of social media and its role in global communication. The first social media platform, Sixdegrees, was launched in 1997 and was founded by Andrew Weinreich. The website permitted users to list their friends and family members and had various interesting features like bulletin boards, school affiliations and profiles. It was shut down in 2001 after it had over a million users.
Since its inception in 1997, social media has managed to infiltrate half of the 7.7 billion people in the world. Social network platforms almost tripled their total user base in the last decade, from 970 million in 2010 to the number passing 3.81 billion users in 2020.
The spectacular year-on-year adoption of new users on the platforms is, however, slowing down. It now relies on the continuous growth in the number of people with internet access and smartphones, particularly in developing regions.
Social media emerged as a ray of hope during the Covid-19 pandemic with people seeking help with oxygen and hospital bed requirements. If one scrolled through Twitter, Facebook or Instagram, only fervent pleas for beds, oxygen, ventilators and Remdesivir were put across all the major platforms. People also shared their harrowing experiences of losing their near and dear ones on social media platforms and agonising battles of survival.","Technology, social media, communication, connection, network"

"Why MIT, Harvard are selling edX?","During the shutdown amid the pandemic, a large number of people turned to online learning to improve their knowledge and skills, pushing the demand for MOOCs like never before. edX, a nonprofit platform, wants to take full advantage of the potential of the new age and for that it needs more money; so its founders, the MIT and Harvard, are selling it to 2U Inc. for $800 million. Both sides have promised to keep the learner access free. 

Enrollments at MOOCs platforms like edX and Coursera boomed during the pandemic. Students supplemented their usual remote learning with high-quality educational material from some of the world’s best universities. Those with jobs and between-jobs, forced to spend most time at home, turned to such platforms to pick new skills or brush up their knowledge. 

“Taking full advantage of that potential will require capital investments at greater scale than is readily attainable for a nonprofit entity like edX,” Alan M. Garber, provost of Harvard and co-chair of the edX board, told the Harvard Gazette. [https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2021/06/edx-acquired-by-education-technology-company-2u/] 

After the deal, edX will become a public benefit company under 2U. It will continue to its current popular model, offering free courses and certificates with modest fees. edX had worked with 160 partner institutions and reached more than 39 million learners since its founding in 2012. 2U, founded in 2008, helps universities connect academic programs with students using online technologies. Post edX acquisition, it will reach more than 50 million learners worldwide.

With fresh capital infusion from 2U, edX will be able to accelerate its impact at a greater rate, reaching more learners than ever before, serving as trusted digital transformation partners for universities and companies, and furthering research and innovation in teaching and learning,” writes Anant Agarwal, chief executive of edX and a professor of electrical engineering and computer science at MIT. [https://blog.edx.org/edx-and-2u-industry-redefining-combination] 

The deal brings a nonprofit initiative in the business domain, and yet, provides an opportunity to take quality education to underprivileged masses around the world.

After almost 14 days I allowed myself a weak moment and cried,"First the good news . 
Both my parents have beaten the bug-tested negative for Covid 19 yesterday. 
After the good news came, I decided to get back to the world. As my parents ended isolation and my mother entered her fiefdom, her kitchen, I hit the road. I had run out of my gluten free biscuits, green tea even shampoo and conditioner. 
Husband ran errands while I struggled to take care of both my parents who unfortunately caught a break through infection inspite of two doses of vaccine. I however wouldn’t ask him to buy me pumpkin and chia seeds, I was more concerned about making sure my parents get the right amount of proteins in their diet. 
After getting my supplies, I called a friend for a cup of coffee. She was my source of strength while my parents were hospitalized. As I sipped coffee and dug into gooey chocolate truffle cake inspite of my gluten allergy, tears rained out of my eyes. As I spoke about my parents illness, I wept bitterly. 
After 14 days of acting strong- from the moment my brother called me from abroad  saying father has running nose and red eyes, till the moment they tested negative.I didn’t shed a tear, being the emotional me-I cry even when SRK’s mother has tummy ache in movies. I had no time to cry, getting tests done, talking to doctors, hospital staff, arranging medicine, thinking lunch and dinner or even deciding whether monoclonal antibodies were an option-this in between attending calls of 200 relatives who would offer help but never show up. Some did for brief while, totally understandable we have lost our family matriarch to covid and all are extremely scared of the disease. 
The choice was between allowing my brother to come from a country which has banned flights from India and risking his job or managing all myself. 
I chose the later. 
There were many moments when I wanted to just cry, but I didn’t. All those tears it seemed were stored and just broke the barriers yesterday. They however were happy tears.","Health, covid 19, emotions, parents"

Your privacy is once again under attack..,"Battlegrounds mobile India is allegedly sending data of Indian android players to servers in china. Reports suggest that the Chinese servers that are receiving data also include TENCENT, the publisher of PUBG Mobile. According to reports IGN India, the data is also sent to Microsoft Azure servers located in the US, Mumbai and Moscow.  Battleground mobile India is the Indian version of the widely popular pubg mobile game. In September 2020 pubg mobile game was one among the 118 Chinese apps banned in India. The Indian govt. found these apps to be “prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity “of the country. As per the reports the data sent and received by the battlegrounds mobile India APK is from china mobile communications servers in Beijing .IGN reproduces these results by installing a data packet sniffer app on android phone; the app reveals which server a device communicates with. Upon setting it to legal servers that battleground mobile India would talk to, an entire game was played. After the game, a quick who is search for one of the servers spotted in the logs revealed that it was run by china mobile communication corporation. WHOIS search engine is used to track the origin of an IP Address.
AN UNKEPT PROMISE 
Krafton the maker of battleground said that privacy and security of Indian player data will be given top most priority. The South Korean company even claimed to cut ties with Tencent, removing the Chinese company as a publisher of pubg mobile. This recent development seems to be contradictory to what was earlier committed. Battleground India was launched as a beta tester in the early June it was made available to all on 17 June. It has already crossed 5m+ downloads. Soon it will be available for all the users.  China is leaving no stone unturned to establish its monarch over everything. Earlier the apps were banned due to the geopolitical tensions between the two.

Seattle, for example, at 104 degrees F (40 C), broke all previous highs. Portland, Oregon, broke its all-time heat record one day, and went four degrees above it, to 112 F (44 C) the next day. It has been a “historic” heat wave, a symptom of climate change, and it is caused by something called ‘heat dome’. 

A heat dome occurs when the atmosphere traps hot ocean air like a lid or cap, explains the National Ocean Service. When strong, high-pressure atmospheric conditions combine with influences from La Niña [the opposite of El Nino], it creates vast areas of sweltering heat that gets trapped under the high-pressure ‘dome.’ Its main trigger was a strong contrast (called ‘gradient’) in ocean temperatures from west to east in the tropical Pacific Ocean during the preceding winter.

Simply put, it’s like a swimming pool with the heater turned on. Temperatures rise in the areas surrounding the heater jets, but the rest of the pool takes time to warm up. The western Pacific’s temperatures have risen over the past few decades as compared to the eastern Pacific, creating a strong temperature gradient. It causes more warm air, heated by the ocean surface, to rise over the western Pacific. The warm air coming from the western Pacific then gets trapped in the jet stream as it approaches land. When that hot air arrives over land, the atmosphere traps the hot air as if a lid was put on it. Winds can move the heat dome around – also called a heat wave.

While the one in pacific is quite rare, on the whole, heat dome phenomena have occurred more frequently as global temperatures have increased over the years. 

In any case, global warming is leading to heat extremes. The National Weather Service forecast for July-September says the nation will face higher temperatures, with the most extreme highs occurring in the Northeast.

"What are you, the victim or the doer ?","Tragic and horrible things happen to all of us, the things that are beyond our control, getting sick, a cheating partner, glass ceilings, situations where we do end up being victims of our unfortunate destiny or of the actions of someone else, we cannot change that, but do we have a control of the narrative of us being the victim ?

I am specifically talking about the concept of the Victimhood Chic from the Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck by Mark Manson. I read this book about 2 years ago but this concept has stayed with me till today, it basically conveys that people at a disadvantage often end up not taking responsibility for how they choose to react to a particularly bad situation. You don’t choose the horrible things happening to you but you do choose how you handle the ramifications and whether or not you choose to play the victim.

I have been thinking about this lately because the current times have brought with them-self brutal circumstances, we are blaming the government, our bosses, our college managements, even the strangers behind the screen, I am also guilty of blaming the situation or other people for things that if I choose the right reaction for and introspect has the power to  bring in something positive for my life.","motivation, inspiration, doer"
Kashag urges all Tibetans to dedicate Chenrezig mantra on His Holiness’ 86th birthday,"Dharamshala: The Kashag has issued an advisory for the most-awaited Trungkar celebration, the 86th birthday of His Holiness the Dalai Lama on 6 July, amid the Covid-19 pandemic. 

In accordance with the Himachal Pradesh government issued guidelines and SOPs for social gatherings with restriction upto 50 people, Kashag Secretariat directed all monasteries and settlements to avoid congregation of public and instead, mark the day as per traditions: offering of the mandala and white scarves to the portrait of His Holiness the Dalai Lama.

Most importantly, it has urged all Tibetans to recite the Chenrezig mantra, Om Mani Padme Hung, over 1000 times, or alteast 10 rounds of the rosary, the collective roots of virtue which may be dedicated on His Holiness’ birthday.

The six-syllable mantra is associated with the Bodhisattva of compassion and the patron saint of Tibet,  Chenrezig. For Tibetans, His Holiness the Dalai Lama is the human manifestation of Chenrezig. Click here to watch His Holiness’ advice on reciting the mantra.

Every year, Trungkar is celebrated with grandeur, glory and festive spirit unlike any other. This year also, the day will be celebrated with the same fervour, but in a Covid-appropriate manner.

In view of the ongoing efforts to curb the Covid-19 pandemic, CTA will broadcast the official Trungkar celebration via Tibet TV for all to join virtually from the safety of their homes.","his holiness the 14th dalai lama’s 86th birthday, kashag request"

How long can the current vaccines offer protection?,"In the beginning of the pandemic, there were doubts if any vaccine could protect us from the virus for long. Now one can hope for much more. The current lot of vaccines, according to three studies published this week, offers long-time protections, for years.

* People who have received the mRNA vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna) may not need boosters, provided the virus and its variants do not evolve much beyond their current forms, according to one study. [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03738-2]

* Mix-and-match vaccination shows promise, says the second study.

* Booster shots of the AstraZeneca vaccine can enhance immunity, the third report concludes. [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3873839]

The first study found that the mRNA vaccines set off a ‘persistent immune reaction’ in the body, creating immune cells which keep developing for a longer duration. It can thus protect you against the coronavirus for many years. Those with weak immune systems – older people, those taking immunity-suppressing medicines – may require booster doses. But those who survived an infection and received vaccines later may not need additional shots. Some of them may have gained immunity for even lifetime. [The scientists said the other vaccines may have less durable response.] [https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/28/health/coronavirus-vaccine-immunity.html]

The second study suggests opting for an mRNA vaccine as the second dose after a dose of the J&J or AstraZeneca vaccines can produce high levels of antibodies and immune cells. 

In the third study, researchers found that a third dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine generated a strong immune response. The third dose raised antibody levels to a point higher than what was seen a month after the second dose. So, a third shot can provide enhance protection if the efficacy of the first two starts to wane. [https://www.arabnews.com/node/1884771/world]

Together, the three studies, all published on Monday, provide concrete evidence that the world is on the right track with the vaccines. 

However, the research about booster shots enhancing immunity may create distortions in distribution: any rush for boosters may affect the supply to those still waiting for the first doses. Mix-and-Match, on the other hand, can solve logistic issues. [https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/a-mix-and-match-approach-to-covid-19-vaccines-could-provide-logistical-and-immunological-benefits]

Pierre Trudeau’s failures on Indigenous rights tarnish his legacy,"More than a half century ago, Pierre Trudeau became Canada’s 15th prime minister. He is one of the notable holders of this office and his achievements were remarkable. For some, however, his tenure is seen as damaging to Canada, including on Indigenous issues.

Nations sometimes harshly judge their past leaders, especially when they have led through nation-defining events. We see their leadership as having shaped our current political realities. This is particularly so in nations facing unresolved issues of inclusion and fairness; a fractious national spirit has its roots in the past exacerbation of differences and in the lost opportunities for reconciliation.

Canada’s first prime minister, John A. Macdonald, has borne much of this burden of blame when it comes to First Nations. His rigorous efforts to remove the culture, language and life skills of Indigenous communities are now considered by some to be cultural genocide.

Trudeau, however, is a successor to this national shame. He, like too many Canadians, failed to grasp the enormity of this history, or the extent to which it was still in force, with residential schools, Indian Agents and brutal social conditions. His rejection of emerging Indigenous self-government contributed to this ongoing national tragedy.

Trudeau understood the conditions

Trudeau understood fully the conditions in which many Indigenous Peoples lived in 1969. Yet he found the notion of treaty rights between two groups within the same society or special status for any group at odds with his notion of common and equal citizenship.

He and Jean Chrétien, his minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development at the time, proposed in a white paper in 1969 that the special legal relationship between First Nations and the government of Canada be severed and all Indigenous Peoples fully integrated into Canadian life.

The paper was met with forceful opposition from Indigenous leaders across the country and sparked a new era of Indigenous political organizing in Canada. Trudeau soon recognized that his largely assimilationist policy was not likely to convince anyone that it was either workable or just.

Tea comfort,"History of tea is still a riddle to solve some days its history lies in the land of the China while some says it was first found in Britain. But today it is world wide the most famous drink. Every nation or state have unique receipe to make tea. Beginning with the land of China, they use it with herbs. Chinese people who have their own taste and style use their certain herbs and put them in hot or medium temperature water to intake that. While in Britain it is consumed with sandwiches or cakes as they wish to. Mostly they like sweet taste of tea. In similar manner the style and taste of tea differs everywhere.  In India we made with milk and sugar with very essential tea powder. Again in India as well the style of cooking it varies from north to south as well as east to west. 

In Malaysia also they prepare similar kind of drink like Indians. But they call it ""Teh Tarik"" or pulled tea with the similar elements as used in Indian style of tea. USA people take cold tea, interestingly, while the tea is still hot but by putting ice in that drink they make the tea cold. 

Thailand style of drink is Assam style of iced tea with condensed milk. You can say there also people like to have black tea like USA people but their tea isn't black. So that is the only difference. 

These were just a few examples on how people make tea with their unique style and according to their natural habitat. However what I liked the most about them is that whatever elements are used anywhere the world is United towards one beautiful thing that is ""Tea"".

covidwarriors Covid warriors unity and team work key to maximising help during pandemic.,"These dark times have given experience and stories that would be narrated for many years from now. Everyone who was the part of the mayhem has something to tell. What seemed more apparent during this time was the team work, people who had the urge to allay the pain of one's who were suffering, came together to work efficiently. Indeed every volunteer in that team played their part well.
Jitender Singh is one of the volunteers who has been working with Dilip Pandey, member of Legislative Assembly representing Timarpur. He tells how it was to work with the team.
""The work began in march lockdown in 2020, on record we were able to provide ration to 45,000 people"", there were many requests.""There were 250-300 requests that came in a day, every social media handle wherever we were active was overflowing with sos requests, we were able to send help within one to two hours of the request."" he said.
It was all going well till the hardest time arrived, ""It was  from 20th to 30th of April when we started feeling helpless, there were many requests but it became so difficult as the cases spread and it was then when we saw things becoming less as per our need"" Jitender told Pixstory. 
This came with alot of challenges, "" there were people who needed help urgently but they were not giving proper details, half of the time was wasted in trying to ask them. Sometimes we used to arrange the ventilators and bed but then the person would not need it."" He tells how things turned difficult and it almost became impossible to help.
""Despite whatever challenges came our way, our team under the guidance of Dilip Pandey worked well, I remember how we made possible to arrange a ventilator for a child within two hours and his life was saved"". Jitender said.
He says it was a difficult time for all of us, roaming around for oxygen was a nightmare,  but again with unity in the team work went well.","covid 19, covid warriors"

"Meghdoot: The Monsoon Magic 16 Kalidas, Meghdoot and monsoon clouds","Did you find out who first coined the word ‘Meghdoot’? If not, read on.

Meghadoot, as I told you yesterday, literally means cloud messenger. The great poet Kalidasa had written a very lyrical poem which was named ‘Meghdoot’, one of the classics of Sanskrit literature from 5th century CE.
There are little more than 100 stanzas in Meghdoot, which has two parts: Purvamegha (Previous cloud) and Uttaramegha (Consequent cloud). 

The story revolves around how the main character Yaksha, exiled from Kuber Nagari and stationed at Ramgiri in central India, delegates a passing raincloud to take his message to his far away wife and describes the path all along till north India to the city of Alka in the Himalayas. Experts tell us that the depiction is so vivid, so pictorial that a reader actually can experience as if he or she is flying along the cloud.

And you know what is the best part? The sky way described by Yaksha, means, described by Kalidasa, is highly similar to the trajectory of monsoon clouds even today. “Kalidasa’s Meghadootam is not only a poem of great beauty but an accurate scientific statement about the monsoon clouds and winds. What Kalidasa wrote about the monsoon 1600 years ago, can be said to be scientifically sound by today’s standards. In some respects, Kalidasa remains ahead of the scientists of the 21st century and they can learn from him and draw inspiration for doing further research in the monsoon,”  wrote Prof R R Kelkar, former Director General of the India Meteorological Department, New Delhi (1998-2003), in his blog.

Read Pro Kelkar’s blog on Meghdoot here: https://rrkelkar.wordpress.com/2009/06/23/kalidasa-the-poet-with-a-scientist%E2%80%99s-mind/ 

That explains the importance of the name ‘Meghdoot’ for this series. And I hope you all had fun learning about our monsoon as much as I had while doing this series. Enjoy. Bye.","rainfall, india, monsoon, sanskrit, kalidasa, meghdoot"

"Sheroes Hangout Cafe,  Lucknow. 
An introduction.","With an aim to provide acid attack survivors with equitable opportunities to thrive and participate in inclusive communities, Chhanv Foundation started Café Sheroes Hangout Project which not only provides employment opportunities to these survivors but also a platform where they can portray themselves courageously.

In an attempt to provide acid attack survivors with a way to earn sustainable livelihood, the first cafe was inaugurated in Agra in December, 2014. This was also Chhanv Foundation’s first step towards empowerment of Acid Attack Survivors. Subsequently, the second cafe was opened in Lucknow in 2016. The cafes employ almost 30 survivors at each location in the present day.

Sheroes Hangout is not just a café, it is a substantial project that helps these survivors in as many ways as possible. Not only do the cafes provide their employees with financial support and dignity but also a means to rehabilitate the survivors back into society. They stand as symbols of empowerment, and fight against the very stigma that pushes one down. A fight started by the Stop Acid Attack Campaign a leading intervention fighting against acid attacks in India since 2013. It is a seminal effort in bringing awareness on the rising number of acid violence occurring in India. Each survivor’s persona; their grit and drive strikes as much inspiration as any modern day superhero.

Sheroes Hangout Cafe is the only cafe in the world to be run by Acid Attack survivors, who rose beyond the trauma and discrimination. It is truly a place where one can meet real life She-Heroes.","Environment, Politics, history, politics, women's rights, human rights, ngo, humanity, empowerment, empowered, humanitarian cause, survivors, cafe, acid attack, sheroes"

"'A Tale of Two Cities' - Texture of time I missed when first read in school, hence a re-read!","Dickens’ ‘A Tale of Two Cities’ , the story of which unfolds in the background of the French Revolution of 1789, has always fascinated me. I first read an abridged version in school, and except for the guillotine, understood little of the novel, except as a romance involving love and sacrifice. In college, as a history major, we tried to deal with the immense complexities of the revolution and the violence it unleashed. No one thought of enriching our understanding of the revolution by reading literature pertaining to the revolution.

It was only after retirement from service that I renewed my interest in the French Revolution, such a seminal event in world history. It was  on reading ‘A Tale of Two Cities’ that I understood how much of the texture of the times I had missed by not reading this book in college. 

The novel opens in 1775 and carries on till the heydays of La guillotine in 1792, offering a panoramic view of French history, as played out in its chateaux as well as the streets of Paris. It subtly deals with the shift of power from the nobility to the people in the street bringing out the injustices, on both sides,wrought by untrammelled power.

Dickens is a master of characterisation and the characters live with you well after you have put down the book. This novel is no exception- Sidney Carton, Lucy, Dr. Manette, Mr. Jarvis Lorry, Madam and Monsieur Defarge as well as Jerry Cruncher and Miss Pross will continue to inhabit our mental space for a long time.

Dickens is always a master of prose but the opening and closing lines of this masterpiece are perhaps his most memorable.","a tale of two cities, charles dickens, ajit lal"

Ten biggest known Asteroid Impacts,"Earth's craters are enduring testaments to direct asteroid hits. And though millions—in some cases billions—of years of erosion have made it difficult to determine the exact size of the meteorites, there is a general scientific consensus around the world's largest craters, which mark the largest asteroid impacts.

Here are the ten biggest known:

1. Vredefort Crater

Asteroid impact date: Estimated 2 billion years ago

Location: Free State, South Africa

Specs: Also known as the Vredefort Dome, the Vredefort crater has an estimated radius of 118 miles (190 kilometers), making it the world's largest known impact structure.

2. Sudbury Basin

Asteroid impact date: Estimated 1.8 billion years ago

Location: Ontario, Canada

Specs: The Sudbury Basin is considered one of largest impact structures on Earth, with an estimated diameter of 81 miles (130 kilometers). 

3. Acraman Crater

Asteroid impact date: Estimated 580 million years ago

Location: South Australia, Australia

Specs: impact structure has an estimated diameter of 56 miles (90 kilometers).

4. Woodleigh Crater

Asteroid impact date: Estimated 364 million years ago

Location: Western Australia, Australia

Specs: Reports on its diameter vary from 25 to 75 miles (40 to 120 kilometers).


5. Manicouagan Crater

Asteroid impact date: Estimated 215 million years ago

Location: Quebec, Canada

Specs: This impact crater formed what is now Lake Manicouagan. Even with erosion, it's considered one of the largest and best-preserved craters on Earth, with an estimated diameter of 62 miles (100 kilometers).

6. Morokweng Crater

Asteroid impact date: Estimated 145 million years ago

Location: North West, South Africa

7. Kara Crater

Asteroid impact date: Estimated 70.3 million years ago

Location: Nenetsia, Russia

8. Chicxulub Crater

Asteroid impact date: Estimated 65 million years ago

Location: Yucatán, Mexico

Specs:  Estimates of its actual diameter range from 106 to a whooping 186 miles (170 to 300 kilometers), which if proved right could mean it's the biggest.

9. Popigai Crater

Asteroid impact date: Estimated 35.7 million years ago

Location: Siberia, Russia

Specs:  These diamonds have been referred to as ""impact diamonds.""

10. Chesapeake Bay Crater

Asteroid impact date: Estimated 35 million years ago

Location: Virginia, United States

Specs:  Estimates suggest this crater is 53 miles (85 kilometers) wide.","cosmos, asteroid, impacts"

What's the coffee nap ?,"Drinking coffee before a nap? Sounds a little counterintuitive, doesn’t it? 
Caffeine naps are the latest evolution. When you feel drowsy and your eyelids begin to close right after that heavy lunch – instead of gulping down a cup of coffee or taking a 20-minute power nap – try a caffeine nap.

The concept?
To drink a cup of coffee and then take a 20-minute nap. 
It takes at least 20 minutes for the caffeine to kick into your system – giving you enough time to re energise with a quick 20-minute nap.

How does this work?
Well, when the caffeine enters your system, it takes at least 20 minutes for its effects to start showing. When you feel tired your body produces adenosine. When you sleep – your body begins getting rid of this adenosine – and gulping down a cup of coffee before this helps boost your energy levels.

According to research conducted in the 1990s, drinking a cup of coffee after a midday nap can increase concentration, performance skills, and cognition compared to taking a nap alone.

In their conclusion, the researchers stated that ""the combination of a nap and caffeine was more effective in maintaining alertness and performance than was the nap alone.""
﻿
Hence by using both the components of a power nap and a coffee kick - you wake up alive and kicking!

"Catholic Church response to sexual abuse must centre on survivor well-being, not defensiveness","In light of the recent discovery of 215 Indigenous children in unmarked graves at a former Catholic-run residential school in British Columbia and investigations at other former residential schools, there have been renewed calls for the Pope to apologize for residential schools and for the Catholic Church to release its records.

The story has also turned public scrutiny on how the Catholic Church has responded to other calls to apologize and be accountable to victims in cases of sexual abuse both in residential schools and throughout the church.

In 2020, I received a federal grant to study the Catholic Church as an organization that can be engaged in potentially contradictory practices to their principles, mission and values. This includes examining the content of websites and electronic documents — including safe and responsible ministry policies, protocols and codes of conduct — of the 18 Catholic archdioceses across Canada. Chiedza Chigumba, a doctoral student at Saint Mary’s University, is working with me as a research assistant on the project.

The guidelines on clergy sexual abuse issued by the Canadian Conference on Catholic Bishops, which were updated in 2018, state that “victims must come first.”

But preliminary research has provided some evidence of how parts of the church are trapped within defensive and legalistic language in their policies and codes of conduct related to preventing, addressing and reporting sexual abuse.

A main implication is that not only is it time for church leaders to better walk the talk of putting the needs of the vulnerable and victims first, it is also time to change the tone of the talk.

The church must move towards a victim-focused and trauma-informed language and corresponding practices of accountability dedicated to acknowledging and transforming a church culture of denialism, complicity, conformity and protectionism.
Devastating effects

Much of my earlier research involved studying business from a critical perspective, often involving case studies of irresponsible corporate practices.

In 2010, as a practising Catholic, I blew the whistle when I learned a priest who was convicted of sexually abusing boys in the 1990s in Newfoundland was participating in ministry with young children in a Nova Scotia parish.

6. khaki files –  Devil’s Advocate: I had to find out about the advocate's murder,"Devil’s Advocate continues ………….

I beckoned the tall man over and asked him, ‘Did you kill Bawa Gurcharan Singh?’
‘Yes, sir,’ he said with a straight face. ‘What is your name?’
‘Sir, Manjeet Singh.’
Even though the incident had taken place nearly twenty years ago, I remembered some facts of the case.
‘You were not alone when this happened. There was someone else with you.’
‘Sir, there were two other people with me.’ ‘Where is the main guy?’
‘Sir, I was the main guy. It was I who pulled the trigger. The Mathura Police killed my accomplice Brij Mohan in an encounter later.’

This again rang a bell and memories came rushing in. A close relative of a senior colleague (a former commissioner of the Mumbai Police) was kidnapped from his home in Jhansi in August 1991 and kept hostage.

 The ransom demanded was staggering and the hostage’s family was not in a position to pay it. My colleague asked me to help. He had come to know that Shailendra Sagar, the senior superintendent of police (SSP), Jhansi, was my batchmate. I called up Shailendra who, of course, was aware of the case and said he was doing his best. Through good luck and some smart sleuthing, not only did Sagar rescue the hostage, but he also killed the kidnapper Brij Mohan Singh in a fierce encounter that took place in a sugar cane field in Mathura.

I crossed paths with Gurcharan Singh under circumstances that were rather convoluted. To explain them I need to  give a bit of background on some of the momentous events that took place in our country in the 1970s, ’80s and ’90s. One such event was the mass agitation against the Mandal Commission recommendations.

What's wrong with Sri Lankan cricket?,"The bio-bubble breach by Mendis, Dickwella and Gunathilaka is making every one in Sri Lanka angry.

The Sri Lanka cricket boards paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to maintain biosecure bubbles. 

Special government approvals were given so the tour could proceed.

5. khaki files –  Devil’s Advocate: An advocate from my past,"Devil’s Advocate continues ………….

Soon the inspection was over and my entourage was ushered to a garden within the jail premises for tea and refreshments. Plastic chairs and tables were laid out neatly on a manicured lawn surrounded by rows of flowers in bloom, overhanging trees and an artificial lake full of geese. Alongside was a flock of pigeons feeding merrily under the setting sun. I was told by the gardener that the pigeons were set free early every morning and by evening they returned to their allotted pigeonholes without fail. The sylvan surroundings belied the fact that we were sitting in a jail and being served tea by people convicted of heinous offences.

By now, I was totally at ease. The convicts, when seen in flesh and blood inside a jail, were the antithesis of whatever we imagine them to be. They were calm, docile and seemed at peace with themselves. I felt the time was right to ask further questions about the tall and muscular man who had led us all the way through my inspection.

I turned to the superintendent and inquired, ‘Whom did the man who walked ahead of us murder?’

The superintendent was not too sure. His deputy came to his help. ‘Sir, he was an advocate who lived in Model Town.’

I wanted to know more because by now several bells were ringing in my head.

‘What was the advocate’s name?’ I asked impatiently. His reply hit me like the proverbial bolt from the blue, leaving me shaken.
‘Sir, his name was Bawa Gurcharan Singh.’ ‘Oh my god, is that so?’ I blurted involuntarily.
I had known Bawa Gurcharan Singh, an eminent advocate, only too well. Not only had I known him, I was deeply indebted to him. Nearly twenty years ago he had come to my rescue when I faced trying times fighting a public interest litigation (PIL) filed against my officers and myself. The circumstances were such that no other advocate was willing to take our brief and argue our case in the Delhi High Court. But, more about that later.

Obama says rise of misinformation 'worries me' and should worry everyone,"Someone needs to introduce this man to Pixstory!

The former President argued that the only way the country's political institutions will work is if both parties agree to certain rules and key principles.

“To know that one of our two major political parties, a strong majority of people in this party, actually believed in a falsehood about the election results, the degree to which misinformation is now disseminated at warp speed in coordinated ways that we haven't seen before, and that the guardrails I thought were in place around many of our democratic institutions really depend on the two parties agreeing to those ground rules.""

FRom N 95 to FFP3 - upgraded masks cut 100 % infection,"While N95 masks are still considered to be the best, a recent study has shown an upgraded version of a mask which fully seals the face called FFP3 cuts infection to about 100 percent . 

A study by Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust research has found that the quality of face masks healthcare workers wear makes a huge difference to their risk of coronavirus infections. 
Wearing a high grade mask known as an FFP3 - FIltering Face Piece 3 , can provide up to 100%. Protection. 
The masks which completely seal the face as supposed to be better than the loose fitting surgical masks which allow airflow from the sides. 
Professional bodies across the world have long campaigned for staff to be given better personal protective equipment.

Staff working on Covid wards at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge who were issued with filtering face piece 3 (FFP3) respirators had a lower infection rate than people in the wider community.

The masks, designed to prevent the transmission of aerosols. 
So remember cloth masks are barely a protection, surgical masks double which can be sealed off with a cloth mask are better protecting as they are liquid resistant. 
The best form of protection comes from face sealing N 95s.

How ‘colonialism by paper cuts’ has undermined Indigenous pandemic leadership,"In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Tŝilhqot’in National Government (TNG) in British Columbia immediately began preparations for emergency response.

As part of its rapid response, TNG secured contracts with wholesale distributors for food and cleaning supplies to be distributed by staff to community members. This direct delivery reduced community risk of exposure by avoiding having multiple families travel into urban centres, ensured food security for self-isolating households and provided support for those who lost employment.

But the supplies were held up. The issue? A forklift.

The Nation’s emergency response was hampered by waiting for British Columbia’s provincial funding approval through the Emergency Support Service Program to rent a forklift to move pallets of food off the delivery truck.

Requiring that approval is an unnecessary administrative burden. It is a form of colonialism by “paper cuts,” an expression that gained some attention after the Final Report on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls was released. The term captures how policy and bureaucracy quietly perpetuate colonialism.

One staff member observed: “It sounds like a crazy world where you need approval for a forklift before you can give food to communities in the middle of a pandemic, but those are the types of conversations that we needed to have.”

This staff member spoke to us for our Tŝilhqot’in-led research project on the COVID-19 pandemic, which documented how the Nation exercised its laws and jurisdiction to keep its citizens safe. We are University of British Columbia researchers and a Tŝilhqot’in citizen from ʔEsdilagh, who work with the Nation on emergencies.

Relying on dozens of interviews during the first wave of the pandemic, we produced a detailed report on the Tŝilhqot’in response, Dada Nentsen Gha Yatastɨg/ Tŝilhqot’in in the Time of COVID (which translated means, “I am going to tell you about a very bad disease”).

One of the clear themes of this research is that the minutiae of bureaucratic policy and procedure perpetuates colonialism. Subtle colonialism undermined a fully Tŝilhqot’in-led pandemic response.

Hello Tea Lovers!,"“You can never get a cup of tea large enough or a book long enough to suit me.” - C.S. Lewis

Most of you, specially who are Indians cannot deny the fact that Tea i.e. Chai holds a very special significance in our lives.
Tea is an essential element of our day to day life and we all love it. Usually our elders have a habit of reading newspapers with the morning Tea. If they don't get their morning Tea, they feel like their day is incomplete.

Tea is an aromatic beverage prepared by pouring hot or boiling water over cured or fresh leaves of 'Camellia sinensis', an evergreen shrub native to China and East Asia. After water, it is the most widely consumed drink in the world. There are many different types of tea, like Chinese greens and Darjeeling, have a cooling, slightly bitter, and astringent flavour while others have vastly different profiles that include sweet or grassy notes. Tea has a stimulating effect in humans primarily due to its caffeine content.

Indian tea culture is strong, the drink is the most popular hot beverage in the country. It is consumed daily in almost all houses, offered to guests, consumed in high amounts in domestic and official surroundings, and is made with the addition of milk with or without spices, and usually sweetened. Tea is usually served with biscuits.

Numerous studies have shown that a variety of teas may boost your immune system, fight off inflammation, and even ward off cancer and heart disease while some brews provide more health advantages than others, there’s plenty of evidence that regularly drinking tea can have a lasting impact on your wellness.
Though it provide health benefits and pleasure but it can cause you some problems also like Tea leaves naturally contain caffeine and overconsuming caffeine from tea, or any other source, may contribute to feelings of anxiety, stress, and restlessness. Also, the caffeine in tea may cause heartburn.
So these are the things that you all should keep in mind. I am not saying that consuming tea is good or bad but you should consume it in a limit. Many people are tea addicts and consume many cups in a day which can cause them problems in a long run.","Food, chai, tea, beverage"

"Sorry, you probably won't be playing GTA 6 anytime soon","GTA 6 will reportedly be out in 2025. Fans have been waiting for almost eight years for a new Grand Theft Auto game, and according to one leaker with a solid track record, that gap between main entry releases won't be over until 2025.

Tom Henderson, who previously leaked Call of Duty and Battlefield 2042 details has released a new video and in it, he claimed that GTA 6 will be set in a modern-day version of Vice City. This runs contrary to previous reports that GTA 6 would be set in the 1980s, with Henderson claiming that developer Rockstar wants to ensure as much freedom as possible for its staff when it comes to creating content for GTA Online.

Henderson also discussed a potential for the GTA 6 map to change over time, similar to how Epic Games regularly overhauls its Fortnite map during end-of-season events. There was also a mention of GTA 6 having multiple playable characters, something which GTA 5 introduced to the series when it first came out.

बिहार प्रदेश कांग्रेस में अध्यक्ष पद को लेकर घमासान,"बिहार प्रदेश कांग्रेस कमिटी में अध्यक्ष पद के लिए दावेदारी के लिए घमासान मचा है। स्थिति एक अनार सौ बीमार जैसी बनी हुई है। पद पाने के होड़ में कई नेता अपने समर्थकों के साथ दिल्ली में कैंप कर रहे है, वही दूसरी तरफ़ अन्य वरिष्ठ नेता पार्टी आलाकमान पर इस विषय पर बात करने की कोशिश में लगे हुए हैं।

बताया जा रहा है कि प्रदेश इकाई में अध्यक्ष बदलने की कवायद तेज तब हुई जब बिहार में अखिल भारतीय कांग्रेस कमेटी के इंचार्ज भक्त चरण दास ने बिहार में विगत दिनों राज्यव्यापी किसान आंदोलन और कार्यकर्ता सम्मेलन पर आधारित रिपोर्ट पार्टी आलाकमान को सौंपने की तैयारी में लगे। वैसे, पार्टी कई अन्य प्रदेशों यथा उत्तर प्रदेश, हिमाचल प्रदेश, पंजाब, राजस्थान आदि, जहाँ चुनाव होने हैं, में अध्यक्ष बदलने की प्रक्रिया तेज कर दी है।

कुछ वरिष्ठ नेताओं की मानें तो दास ने औरंगाबाद ज़िले के कुटुंबा विधायक राजेश राम को प्रदेश अध्यक्ष बनाने की मंसा ज़ाहिर की है। उसके साथ ही प्रदेश कमिटी में से सात लोगों का नाम कार्यकारी अध्यक्ष के रूप में नामित करने का प्रस्ताव तैयार किया है। हालाँकि राजेश राम के नाम पर पार्टी में हो रहे है घोर विरोध के चलते पार्टी ने नए प्रदेश अध्यक्ष का चुनाव को फ़िलहाल ठंडे बस्ते में डाल दिया है।

बिहार प्रभारी दास का कहना है कि अध्यक्ष पद का चुनाव को रोक दिया गया है और निवर्तमान अध्यक्ष मदन मोहन झा को पार्टी की गतिविधियों को सुचारु रूप से चलाने के लिए कुछ कमिटीयों, यथा वर्किंग कमिटी, कोऑर्डिनेशन कमेटी और सलाहकार समिति, जिसमे युवा और वरिष्ठ नेताओं को जगह दिया जाएगा, प्रस्तावित है। कुमार आशीष, प्रवीण सिंह कुशवाहा, पूर्व रीगा विधायक अमित कुमार टुन्ना, पूर्व विधायक मनोज कुमार सिंह, महिला कांग्रेस की अध्यक्षा अमिता भूषण, अखिल भारतीय कॉंग्रेस के सचिव चंदन यादव और शाकिलुर रहमान को कार्यकारी अध्यक्ष बनाने की बात चल रही है।

Covaxin neutralises Covid’s Alpha & Delta variants,"India's Covaxin, developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research, effectively neutralises both Alpha and Delta variants of coronavirus, the US' National Institute of Health has said.
The NIH said results of two studies of blood serum from people who had received Covaxin suggest that the vaccine generates antibodies that effectively neutralise the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) and B.1.617 (Delta) variants of SARS-CoV-2, first identified in the UK and India, respectively.

The top American health research institute, which has a history of strong scientific collaboration with India, also said that an adjuvant developed with funding from it has contributed to the success of the highly efficacious Covaxin, which has been administered to roughly 25 million people till date in India and elsewhere.

The single-day rise in fresh cases was recorded below 40,000 after 102 days, bringing India's COVID-19 infection tally to 3,03,16,897, while the daily fatalities remained below 1,000 for the second consecutive day, according to the Union Health Ministry data updated on Tuesday.

"With cyberattacks growing more frequent and disruptive, a unified approach is essential","Cyberwarfare consists of co-ordinated attacks of mass disruption (AMD). In the June summit between U.S. and Russian presidents Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin, cyberwarfare was a topic of discussion. While the Biden-Putin summit appears to be “quite constructive,” cyberwarfare remains perplexing to politicians.

Attacks of mass disruption are similar to the latest ransomware attacks on SolarWinds and Colonial Pipeline — imagine several co-ordinated similar attacks. For the time being, organizations should prepare for increasing disruptions and data losses caused by ransomware.

Attacks of mass disruption may not cause massive casualties, but nations could lose their ability to function and respond to adversaries, economies can be crippled and governments may be undermined. The 2015 cyberattack on Ukraine presented a scenario of grounding a nation using a well co-ordinated cyberattack.

The lessons are clear — the impact of cyberattacks is too serious to ignore and pre-planned contingencies may be the only thing that works to address them.

Cyberattack losses

In 2020, IBM estimated US$1.5 billion losses in known observed cyberattacks.

Over the past two decades, two factors have contributed to the possibility of cyberwarfare. First is the increased reliance on digital infrastructure and systems. Second is the continuous increase in damages inflicted by criminal or state-based cyberattacks.

These provide sufficient justification for experts to sound the alarm on cybersecurity.

Other factors increase the risks even more. The complexity of the modern economy and its supply chains create an environment of highly impactful disruptions. Attacks of mass disruption on seemingly irrelevant but well-selected entities — like infrastructure companies — could trigger a domino effect that causes disruptions and economic losses far beyond the scale of the target.

Russia used U.S. cyberinfrastructure to influence the 2016 election. In May 2021, there were attacks on software developer SolarWinds Inc., oil infrastructure company Colonial Pipeline and JBS, the world’s largest meat supplier.

Currently, most cyberattacks originating from Russia use known tactics like email phishing, ransomware-as-a-service and poor password practices.

Lipton’s Seat: Best hike for tea enthusiasts in Sri Lanka,"8km, 2 hours

For a taste – or should that be a sip? – of Sri Lanka's tea country, head to the town of Haputale, floating in a sea of tea gardens in the middle of the island. The tea estate at Dambatenne was founded in 1890 by Thomas Lipton, whose name still appears on teabags served at breakfast all over the globe, and the lookout is known as Lipton’s Seat, where he came to survey the plantations. 

History aside, the viewpoint makes a fine day walk from Haputale, and you can combine the trip with a tour of the still-working Dambatenne Tea Factory to see the tea-making process.

From the factory, tangled footpaths climb for about 8km to reach the lookout, winding through tea plantations crowded with ‘tea pluckers’ filling their bags with the raw ingredient for tomorrow’s cuppas. In practice, most visitors do the trip in reverse, taking a bus or tuk-tuk to Lipton’s Seat to arrive early in the morning when the views are clearest, and then strolling downhill through the tea gardens to reach the factory.","tea, sri lanka"

Adams holds small lead over Garcia after 1st ranked choice voting results in NYC mayoral race,"Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams is ahead in the Democratic Primary for mayor after the NYC Board of Elections calculated who would win with only in person votes under the new ranked choice voting system.

Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams was ahead by around 9% in preliminary 1st choice results released the evening of the primary. Tuesday’s final count showed he now edges out Kathryn Garcia by just over 2%.

The new ranked choice count includes about 800,000 in-person ballots cast by Democratic primary voters, including 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th choices.  It excludes about 130,000 absentee ballots that are still being processed by the BOE.

The second to last round of counting showed Adams with 40.9%, former counsel to Mayor Bill de Blasio Maya Wiley with 29.3% and former Sanitation Commissioner Katheryn Garcia with 29.8%.  In the final ranked choice count Adams had 51.1% and Garcia had 48.9%

This much closer result gives some hope to Garcia and Wiley.  Both are counting on absentee ballots to propel them to victory.

“Democracy, as John Lewis said, is an act. And New York City residents engaged in one of the central acts of democracy! They voted,” Wiley said. “And they acted when they chose overwhelmingly to adopt ranked-choice voting. I said on election night, we must allow the democratic process to continue and count every vote so that New Yorkers have faith in our democracy and government. And we must all support its results.” 

Monday began the process of scanning absentees into the BOE computer system.  First, each one was opened under the careful observation of a Republican and Democrat, sometimes campaign observers keeping unofficial tallies.

A second ranked choice voting count including most of the absentee ballots will be released Tuesday, July 6.  This second count will likely determine enough information to know the winner in most races, including the race for mayor.   

The Board of Elections officials have promised final certified results during the week of July 12.  It is after this date that absentee ballots eligible to be “cured” due to issues like a missing signature are due.

A Post Trump Movement in Southern California,"Online activism is spilling into the streets of Southern California, sparking a post-Trump movement.
 It is reported that leaders with ties to the Capitol riot have shut down a local vaccine site and paused plans for vaccine passports.
A week before California reopened its economy, a group of 100 or so demonstrators gathered in front of the Orange County Board of Supervisors here to decry lingering mask mandates and other health restrictions.

Whipped up by a misleading campaign of social media promotion, doorstep fliers and TV ads, they carried signs that read, “RIP COVID VAX VICTIMS” and “My Body, My Choice, No Vax.” The previous month, more than 600 people had gathered in the same spot to protest a voluntary digital vaccine passport — by falsely claiming it would be mandatory, comparing it to Nazis forcing Jews to wear yellow stars.

NYC college student shot in the arm while playing basketball in Manhattan,"A stray bullet struck a college student in the arm as he played basketball outside a Manhattan public housing complex, police said Tuesday.

The 19-year-old victim, a sophomore and linebacker for ASA College’s football team, was running a basketball court behind the Amsterdam Houses near Lincoln Square about 9 p.m. Monday when someone opened fire on a rival, cops said.

The teen told police he was shooting hoops when he heard a gunshot, authorities said. A second later, he felt a pain in his arm and realized he’d been shot. He never saw the gunman, police said.

He was rushed to St. Luke’s Hospital, where he was treated and released.

"Land worth millions sold by Big Ag corporation to Sonny Perdue’s company for $250,000","It was a curious time for Sonny Perdue to close a real estate deal.

In February 2017, weeks after President Donald Trump selected him to be agriculture secretary, Perdue’s company bought a small grain plant in South Carolina from one of the biggest agricultural corporations in America.

Had anyone noticed, it would have prompted questions ahead of his confirmation, a period when most nominees lie low and avoid potential controversy. The former governor of Georgia did not disclose the deal — there was no legal requirement to do so.

An examination of public records by The Washington Post has found that the agricultural company, Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM), sold the land at a small fraction of its estimated value just as it stood to benefit from a friendly secretary of agriculture.

Perdue did not respond to repeated requests for comment on the real estate deal. Jackie Anderson, a spokeswoman for Chicago-based ADM, denied that the company sold the property at a discount, saying that ADM began negotiations with Perdue’s former company, AGrowStar, in 2015 — well before Trump was elected — and could not find another buyer.

“This was nothing more than a business decision to sell a significantly underperforming asset,” she said.

Danny Brown, the former president of AGrowStar, confirmed negotiations began in late 2015. But Brown said ADM wanted $4 million for the plant — 16 times what Perdue’s company ultimately paid for it.

The timing of the sale just as Perdue was about to become the most powerful man in U.S. agriculture raises legal and ethics concerns, from the narrow question of whether the secretary followed federal financial disclosure requirements to whether the transaction could have been an attempt to influence an incoming government official, in violation of bribery statutes, ethics lawyers say.

“This stinks to high heaven,” said Julie O’Sullivan, a Georgetown University law professor and former federal prosecutor. “It deserves a prosecutor’s attention,” she added. “Only a prosecutor with the powers of the grand jury can find out, in fact, whether there was a quid pro quo that existed at the time of the deal.”

Supreme Court pulls up environment ministry over ‘diluting green standards’,"The National Green Tribunal (NGT) had found faults with the ministry’s 2017 notification by which new norms for effluent discharge by sewage treatment plants (STPs) in waterbodies were laid down. It held that the new notification would lead to deterioration of the water quality and prescribed stricter standards based on the recommendations of an expert committee.

The Supreme Court on Monday remarked that the ministry of environment should also act like a “ministry for environment”, bemoaning that environmental standards have been constantly diluted in the recent past.

“You must show it is a ministry for environment and not just ‘of environment’. You (ministry) have been constantly diluting the environmental standards. That’s all that has been happening,” commented a bench headed by justice Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud while hearing an appeal by the central government against an order of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in 2019.

NGT had found faults with the ministry’s 2017 notification by which new norms for effluent discharge by sewage treatment plants (STPs) in waterbodies were laid down. It held that the new notification would lead to deterioration of the water quality and prescribed stricter standards based on the recommendations of an expert committee.

While the expert committee had suggested a timeframe of seven years for existing STPs to switch to higher sewage treatment criteria, the tribunal directed that the existing STPs should apply these norms “without any delay”. The NGT had further held that standards recommended for mega and metropolitan cities will also apply to the rest of the country.

Barring the “Unvaccinated”,"It begins. Abu Dhabi has announced that unvaccinated people are seemingly barred from public life. Malls, restaurants, outdoor spaces are all off-limits for those who refuse to shot.

One could’ve foreseen this happening. Unfortunately I believe it will likely happen in the United States as well. The power that so many politicians gained during the pandemic is just too much for them to let go. They say power corrupts.

I believe the American people are smarter than this and will not stand for further lockdowns. Currently, roughly 50% of the country is vaccinated, with many more already recovered from the virus. Preliminary studies show that prior infection gives the same protection as the vaccine, if not more. So any attempt to force those who had the virus but not the vaccine from not doing anything is against the “science.”","Science, vaccine, freedom, abu dhabi, unvaccinated, medical freedom"

U.S. military commander in Afghanistan warns of possible civil war,"The top American military commander in Kabul expressed deep concern Tuesday that the country could slide into civil war and face ""very hard times"" unless its fractious civilian leadership unites and the haphazard array of armed groups joining the anti-Taliban fight are controlled and made ""accountable"" for their actions in battle.

The comments by Gen. Austin “Scott” Miller, who met with a group of journalists, came as Taliban forces continued their rapid advance across northern provinces and expanded into other rural regions. The insurgents also began circling closer to the capital city. In the past 48 hours, officials and Afghan media reported, Taliban fighters have overrun parts of two provinces just north and south of Kabul, and attacked security posts in a third that hugs the city’s western border.

Miller, who is overseeing the drawdown of U.S. forces here but said he would be replaced in its final stages, described the process as going well “from a military standpoint.” But he acknowledged that the looming departure had damaged the morale of Afghan defense forces, which he said were already stretched thin after months of heavy fighting, often with poor support.

“The security situation is not good,” Miller stated, citing the ongoing loss of territory, casualties and government forces withdrawing, while the Taliban have launched a “countrywide offensive” at the same time that peace talks are supposed to be taking place. “There are a lot of questions about why and how this is happening.”

By some expert estimates, Taliban forces now control as many as 140 of the country’s 370 districts and are active or influential in another 170. Both U.S. and Afghan military officials have given much lower estimates, but more districts continue to fall almost daily, either in violent clashes or peaceful surrenders, according to local officials and Afghan media reports.

Covid vaccines: Importance of Oxford study that endorses mix-and-match,"There have been studies across the world on the mix-and-matching of vaccines to combat Covid-19. For example, providing Pfizer doses to AstraZeneca recipients or Moderna recipients.

A few scientific studies have suggested there could be some benefits in combining different vaccines. [https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01359-3]

Plagued by vaccine shortages and skewed supply of different vaccines, many governments have looked at the mix and match results with great interest. But, of course, there has been caution too.

But a new study from the Oxford University is likely to give leg-up to the mix-and-match theory. According to this study, mix and matching the Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca-Oxford generated a “robust” immune response against the virus.

It was part of the Oxford Vaccine Group’s Com-Cov vaccine trial, studying the use of different combinations of Covid-19 vaccines for the first and second immunization doses. [https://comcovstudy.org.uk/home]
“Both ‘mixed’ schedules (Pfizer-BioNTech followed by Oxford-AstraZeneca, and Oxford-AstraZeneca followed by Pfizer-BioNTech) induced high concentrations of antibodies against the SARS-CoV2 spike IgG protein when doses were administered four weeks apart,” the researchers said in a study published in Lancet preprint server Monday. 

The latest finding could provide flexibility to vaccination programs around the world. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/28/robust-immune-response-seen-in-mix-and-match-covid-vaccine-study.html]

The World Health Organization has also supported the mix-and-match vaccine initiatives. Alejandro Cravioto, WHO Chair of Strategic Management, recently said, that the organization was aware of AstraZeneca first dose followed by a Pfizer vaccine as a second dose that it knew for sure that it can be done “without any problems in the sense of efficacy.”

The UK’s deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam has been quoted by the BBC as saying that mixing doses could provide even greater flexibility for a booster program, “while also supporting countries who have further to go with their vaccine rollouts, and who may be experiencing supply difficulties.” [https://www.bbc.com/news/health-57636356]

China-Russia friendship treaty: The significance of timing,"Chinese President has called it ""injection of positive energy into the international community"" and Russia has said that it will further deepen the relations.

The occasion was the extension of the 'China-Russia Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation' that was first signed in 2001 between the two countries. The treaty's extension was announced by Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday.

The state media of China has been playing up the Article 9 of the treaty, which says, ""When a situation arises in which one of the contracting parties deems that… it is confronted with the threat of aggression, the contracting parties shall immediately hold contacts and consultations in order to eliminate such threats."" The agreement also had some additional elements like the two countries declaring to see each other as a prioritized partner, further deepening collaboration and cooperation in politics, security, military, economic and trade. [https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202106/1227305.shtml]

The agreement comes at a time when China has been facing international pressure on the origins of the coronavirus, the human rights situation in the Xinjiang province, its crackdown in Hong Kong and aggressive moves against various countries, including its neighbors.

It is also significant that the treaty has been extended just days before the centenary of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC), which rules the country.

Stressing the importance of the treaty and sending out a message to the world, Xi Jinping said, ""China and Russia have injected positive energy into the international community and set an example of a new type of international relations through their close cooperation, as the world is entering a period of turbulence and change and human development is confronted with multiple crises.""

The joint statement opposed unilateral sanctions and to countries using the excuse of ""democracy"" and ""human rights"" to interfere in other countries' internal affairs. Again, a loud and clear message to the West.

Fact-check: Medal inscribed with ‘swayamsevak’ to be given to Tokyo Olympic volunteers?,"( link https://twitter.com/MajorPoonia/status/1409527298454286341?s=19)

By Kalim Ahmed

Several users on social media have shared a photo of a medal, claiming that it will be presented to the volunteers at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics scheduled to be held from July 23 to August 8. The medal has the word ‘volunteer’ inscribed in several languages including “स्वंयसेवक” (Swayamsevak) in the Devanagari script. BJP member Surendra Poonia’s tweet sharing the alleged medal gained 10,000 likes and over 2,800 retweets as of this writing.

Several others have shared the image.

The claim is viral on both Twitter and Facebook.

Alt News has also received multiple requests to verify the claim on its official mobile application (Android, iOS) and its WhatsApp helpline number (+91 76000 11160).

Fact-check

We looked at the FAQ page on the official Olympics website to see how are the volunteers at the Olympics are awarded and found a few things:

1. The volunteers at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics will be provided with a pre-paid travel card worth 1000/- Yen for day-to-day travel to the venue.

2. All volunteers are responsible for arranging and paying for any accommodation that they may require.

3. The Olympics association will not issue any documents or certificates to volunteers once the volunteer activity is complete.

4. The Olympics website also has a list of items that would be provided to the volunteers, the list does not mention any medal.

According to an article by the Associated Press published in 2019, Olympics volunteers are not paid for their work, they pay for their own lodging and transportation to the host city, they get meals on the days they work, some training, and uniforms to treasure. In Tokyo, they will get up to 1,000 Yen daily to get to work on the city’s vast train system and the Tokyo organisers will provide some insurance. There’s no mention of a volunteer medal anywhere, neither on the official website of the Olympics nor on news publications.

Philippine thinks women radio operators can drive Chinese vessels away at sea,"This is sheer nonsense and tripe. To deter intruders in its maritime territory, the Philippines is pinning its hopes on a new secret weapon – a woman’s voice. Coastguard officials are hoping that a new unit of 81 specially trained female radio operators – dubbed the “Angels of the Sea” – can deter wayward foreign vessels from entering its territory in the conflict-ridden waterway. They are hoping the female operators will remind them of their wives and mothers.

The mastermind of the operation believes that not only will the women’s voices be more likely to ease tensions with foreign crews – who may resent a male operator barking commands at them – but they will also hold a psychological advantage over their opponents due to the matriarchal aspects of Asian societies. The operation is understood to have been influenced by an incident in April in which the pre-recorded voice of a female coastguard operator appeared to drive off seven Chinese vessels caught loitering near a Philippine-claimed reef.

To be honest, perhaps a stronger diplomatic stance and clearer analysis of the geopolitics in the area and a better understanding of how to balance the power interests in the region would serve the Philippine interests better than  voices, whether male or female, at the sea. I hope India desists from picking such loony ideas.","china, philippines"
Grahan web series review,"हमला करने वाला दंगाई होता है, हिन्दु या मुस्लिम नहीं।
राजनीति में कुछ बदलता नहीं है, टलता है और माहौल देखकर इतिहास अपने आप को दोहराता है।

Grahan is an impactful series police procedural story of deteriorating human character which delivers a very memorable and powerful   message.  The series plays out simultaneously in two time zones Bokaro in 2004 and Ranchi in 2016. Before elections the long lost files and secrets of 1984 riots are reopened.  And thus opens a Pandora’s Box where an IPS officer Amrita Singh finds her own father embroiled in murky facts of 1984 when she was young. Grahan tucks at your core. Neither the intention of the creator is to entertain or provide undue drama nor do the actors make it dramatic shifting focus from its humanist value. Layers after layers of truths, hidden secrets, political dirt, communal hatred obviously created for vote banks makes the first few episodes un put down able.  It evokes the frenzy of those dark days, taps the tenderness of youthful love.
It’s so honest, different, neatly woven, emotionally vocative story that penetrates in to our psyche and teaches us a lot about the connect between the politicians, police and the circumstances of civilians. The love story in the 80s is passionate and the repercussions of the riots after 30 yrs. catastrophical. The writers keep the viewer’s smoothly oscillating between both the emotions. Although in the latter episodes often the story stretches itself with a same background score playing again and again at the cost of repetition. But the very fact that 1984 has been used to educate 2021 how not to fall in the trap of poisonous politicians is a very noble intention. It’s one of the most poignant, brilliantly cast, well directed, very well acted and emotionally graphic series I have seen this year. Hindi-language web shows have often addressed weighty socio-political themes in an entertaining way and ended up touching raw nerves in the process. Totally loved it. Highly recommended.","Entertainment, riots, pixstory vibe, 1984, web series, grahan"
"Days after all-party meeting, Sajjad Lone's party disowns Muzzafar Baig","Peoples Conference general secretary Imran Reza Ansari on Tuesday disowned former Jammu and Kashmir deputy chief minister Muzaffar Hussain Baig, saying he was not a member of the party as he had not joined it. 

The development comes days after he and People's Conference chairman Sajjad Ghani Lone attended the all-party meeting on Jammu and Kashmir chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi on June 24.

In an interview to Srinagar-based news agency Kashmir News Service (KNS), Ansari said Baig was not a member of the People's Conference , and that there may be some confusion about his affiliation with the party. 

Sajjad Lone did visit Baig's residence and politics was discussed there besides he thanked the People's Conference for getting his wife Safina Baig elected as DDC chairperson, Ansari said. 

""We were the single largest party in Baramulla with 3 members while no other party had more than 2. Even though we had aspirations within our camp for the chairman's post, she requested me for our support. We did not put any pre-conditions for supporting her and felt she deserved a chance and was a good candidate,"" he said. 


Asked why Baig accompanied Sajjad Lone to the all-party meeting, Ansari said the former People's Democratic Party (PDP) leader had expressed a desire to attend the deliberations and requested the People's Conference chairman to take him along. 

""But at no point did we have any idea about what he is going to speak inside.""

It was reported that Baig had stopped PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti from raising the issue of abrogation of Article 370 at the all-party meeting, claiming the matter was sub-judice and discussing it could amount to contempt of court. 

Ansari said Baig himself has made it clear that he doesn’t belong to any party. ""We share a personal relationship with them. But we have nothing in common with him. politically. Nothing at all,"" he added. ","jammu and kashmir, all party meet, muzaffar baig, sajjad lone, people's conference"

"Palestinians are protesting, this time against their government","The number of angry demonstrators on the streets of West Bank is only increasing with each passing day, and their ire this time is not directed at Israel. Their target is Palestinian Authority's President Mahmoud Abbas.

Hundreds of people have gathered in Ramallah – the headquarters of the PA – and chanted slogans to protest the death of Nizar Banat in the Authority's custody.

43-year-old Banat was known for his social media videos against alleged corruption within the Palestinian Authority. His family has alleged that he was tortured to death by the security forces of the Authority. The protests have grown after the autopsy report, which revealed that Banat had been beaten on the head, chest, neck, legs and hands.

While Palestinian prime minister Mohammad Shtayyeh has said that an investigation would be ordered, the rumblings within the government have started with Nasri Abu Jaish, the labor minister and the People's Party representative in the government resigning from the cabinet.

Palestinian security forces have fired tear gas and stun grenades at the protesters and there have also been clashes among the protesters and the supporters of President Abbas. [https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/6/27/rival-palestinian-groups-clash-at-protest-over-activists-death]

11. Dial D for Don: Gifts from the Gulf- Connecting the Dots on Aftab Ansari,"“Gifts from the Gulf” continues…

Rajeev’s team had arrested most of the perpetrators of the Burman kidnapping case except the ringleaders Aftab Ansari and Asif Raza Khan. During our protracted interactions, we had hit off well and developed a good rapport with each other. I had carefully catalogued the stray bits of information on Aftab given by Rajeev. Many other inputs on Aftab had emerged during the interrogation of Asif Raza Khan by us in the Santalpur Arms Case. My batch-mate Sudhir Sinha, the then Commissioner of Police, Rajkot, was investigating the Bhaskar Parekh kidnapping case. He too had shared several inputs on Aftab and his gang that with me. I put them all together and prepared a dossier on Aftab annexing with it a copy of his passport file obtained from Patna Passport Office. 

When I spoke with Rajeev on the morning of Jan 22, 2002, he gave me details of the terror attack in Kolkata in which four policemen had been killed and several others injured. The terrorists had come riding two motorcycles at 6.30 am and opened fire indiscriminately on policemen deployed at the American Centre as changing of guard was in progress. The policemen had been caught totally by surprise and couldn’t react. Rajeev had received a call at his residence on his landline from one Farhan Malik claiming responsibility for the attack. Having heard Aftab’s voice recorded during the Burman kidnapping case investigations, Rajeev addressed him by his real name. That caught the caller by surprise and he hung up. Aftab then called Anand Bazar Patrika, a Kolkata newspaper, posing to be Farhan Malik and claimed responsibility for the terror attack. It was this news that was flashed all over and had reached the Home Secretary’s ears in Hotel Ashok that morning.

Former South African President Jacob Zuma sentenced to 15 months in prison for contempt,"South Africa's highest court found former President Jacob Zuma guilty of contempt of court and sentenced him to 15 months in prison on Tuesday, a landmark move in the country's long-running corruption saga.

The Constitutional Court of South Africa ordered that Zuma present himself at a police station in his home town of Nkandla or Johannesburg within five days.

In a scathing judgment, Justice Sisi Khampepe ruled: ""There can be no doubt that Mr Zuma is in contempt of court.""

The order stems from Zuma's refusal to appear at an anti-corruption commission to answer questions about his alleged involvement in corruption during his time as president. Zuma has repeatedly denied the allegations.
Judge Khampepe said that Zuma attempted to corrode the legitimacy of the Constitutional Court by conducting a ""politically motivated smear campaign"" against it, the commission and the judiciary.

""No person is above the law ... whatever his rank or condition,"" she said, continuing: ""An act of defiance in respect of a direct judicial order has the potential to precipitate a constitutional crisis.

""If with impunity litigants are allowed to decide which orders they wish to obey, and which they wish to ignore, then our Constitution is not worth the paper on which it is written.""

Priyanka's tryst with Uttar Pradesh,"Will Priyanka Gandhi Vadra do in Uttar Pradesh what her brother Rahul Gandhi did in West Bengal: Withdraw from the electoral race at the last hour?

The political space in UP - where elections  are scheduled in Feb-March 2022 - has been getting extremely crowded. The Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party, an eight party outfit floated by AIMIM chief Asad Ud din Owesi and Nitish Kumar's Janata Dal (United) have all decided to contest separately - leading to the fragmentation of the anti -BJP space. In such a scenario, even Congress leaders don't appear to believe their own boast that the party would be able to form the government on its own. 

A disclaimer here: Realities of electoral politics are often not akin to what popular perceptions suggest. In the initial days, nobody had quite given Mamata Banerjee a chance against the might and firepower of the BJP in the recently concluded West Bengal elections. Earlier, none had thought that Tejaswi Yadav would be able to convert the electoral fight in Bihar into a David versus Goliath tussle. 

But Priyanka's difficulties are that she is yet not being seen as a serious enough player in UP. For the most part, her outage against the horrendous crimes happening under the watch of BJP chief minister Yogi Adityanath have been vent on the microblogging site Twitter. From time to time, she has made lightning visits to the state, but these have been  ""shoot and scoot"" missions, at best. 

After a series of electoral setbacks, the Congress leadership has apparently realised that political power comes neither by way of entitlement, nor because of inheritance. The party leadership, as the little bird says, has come to seriously consider the option of going in for ""common candidates"" and joint campaign programs with like-minded parties in UP. The political grounds in UP are shifting rapidly and in unexpected ways.

"What UN Rights report says about reparations for racism, slavery","In a study launched just after the George Floyd killing and whose report has come just after Derek Chauvin’s sentencing, the UN Human Rights Council has urged global action against racism and to “make amends” including through reparations to people of African descent. The concept of reparations thus gets the backing of the highest global body.

“Reparations” has gained traction in recent times, especially after journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates’s groundbreaking essay [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/06/the-case-for-reparations/361631/], demanding compensation for slavery. It has been an established concept in legal philosophy and reparations have happened through court rulings or even voluntarily. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/01/31/slavery-reparations-seem-impossible-many-places-theyre-already-happening/?itid=lk_interstitial_manual_11] On the centennial of the Tulsa massacre last month, there was a demand to pay reparations to the descendants of those whose businesses were destroyed during the one of the worst racial massacres in the US history. [https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/03/us/tulsa-massacre-reparations/index.html] Reparations are commonly understood as financial payments, but they can take other forms too, for example, providing land, settlements and scholarships to the affected community, or even acknowledgement and apology of past injustices.

That broader approach is what the UN report recommends [https://undocs.org/A/HRC/47/53]. After a survey of individual instances of reparations in many nations, the report says: 

“Yet, no State has comprehensively accounted for the past or for the current impact of systemic racism. … delineations  of State  responsibility  and  the  design  and  financing of  effective  reparations  programmes  that address the temporal and material scope and possible beneficiaries require further definition and negotiation –including but not limited to specific concerns about financial compensation claims.” Beyond money, reparation should also include restitution, rehabilitation, educational reforms, acknowledgment, apologies, memorialization and “guarantees” against further injustice, writes UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet, a former president of Chile, in the report. She also mentions “memorialization, education and awareness-raising” as “catalysts for bolstering demands for change and for debunking false narratives that have permitted a succession of racially discriminatory policies and systems to persist.” [https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/06/28/united-nations-systemic-racism-report/]

The report offers a broad view of centuries of racism and slavery, and seeks a “transformative” approach to address its continued impact today. [https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-57646933] “There is today a momentous opportunity to achieve a turning point for racial equality and justice,” it says.

Fake bill portrays Mumbai petrol pump bill asking people to not vote for PM Modi again,"By Kinjal

An image of a bill from a petrol pump has been gathering quite a lot of traction on social media. Printed on the bottom of a bill is a message that reads, “If you want to reduce petrol price don’t vote Modi again. Thank you visit again!” The name of the pump printed on the alleged bill is ‘Sai Balaji Petroleum HPL Dealer Vikhroli (West) Mumbai’. Users have been sharing the image while targeting the Maharashtra government. Twitter user Archana Shah tweeted the image and wrote, “Look at this. What an amazing statement. Shame on you, Maharashtra government.” (Archive link)

( Link https://twitter.com/archanasah/status/1406476142677164035?s=19)

The image is widespread on Facebook.

The photo is also being shared on WhatsApp with the accompanying claim. Alt News received a few requests to verify it on its mobile app.

In fact, it has actually been doing the rounds online since 2018.

Fake bill

There is no pump in Mumbai named ‘Sai Balaji Petroleum HPL Dealer Vikhroli (West) Mumbai’. There is also no oil company or a fuel retailer called ‘HPL’. There is however Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited but its short form is HPCL.

A closer look at the bill reveals a discrepancy in the font sizes of the words and numbers. These errors have been underlined in the image below.

The date printed on the bill is October 4, 2018, when the BJP-Shiv Sena alliance was in power in Maharashtra and BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis was the chief minister.

Several other fact-checking outlets including Boomlive, The Logical Indian, and SM Hoax Slayer have debunked the fake bill in the past.

These reports carried a sample bill from a petrol pump similar to the viral bill. The URL linked to the sample bill is currently unavailable. But the similarities between both – the name of the pump, its address, the car’s license plate number, and the name of the customer – have been highlighted below.

"No campus life, full fee: How Covid-19 changed IIM journey of batch 2020-22","Students from various IIMs say while their classes have continued online, they are missing out on peer interactions and the personality-building opportunities campus life offers.

Students who joined Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) in 2020 prepared long and hard for one of the toughest entrance exams in the country — the Common Admission Test (CAT) — but have been unable to live the IIM experience fully due to the coronavirus outbreak. While some students got to be on campus for a few months, they had to soon return amid the worsening Covid crisis.

One such student, Swati Singh from the small town of Barabanki in Uttar Pradesh, had appeared for CAT earlier too, but could get into an IIM only in 2020, when she joined the Postgraduate Programme (PGP) at IIM Kozhikode.

"Ahead of Olympics, the vaccination rate in Japan is far from the mark","                        Japan’s vaccination drive has gone from a marathon to a sprint as the country rushes to protect as many of its 126 million people as possible from Covid-19 ahead of the Tokyo Olympics.
Less than a month away from the lighting of the ceremonial torch, the Japanese government recently announced that it had hit the benchmark of vaccinating 1 million people in a single day.
But hobbled by a slow rollout, a severe shortage of doctors and nurses, and by the fact that it must import all its vaccines, Japan has fully vaccinated just a little more than 8 percent of its people, according to the World Health Organization. That’s a big red flag for many public health experts concerned that the world’s biggest sporting event could turn into an Olympic-size superspreader event.
Part of the reason for low vaccination is because, under Japanese law, only doctors and registered nurses are allowed to “legally give injections,”","covid 19, vaccination, japan"
Could climate change have caused Florida building collapse?,"What could have caused the partial collapse of Champlain Towers in Surfside, Florida? Investigations are on into the possible structural factors, but climate change could also be an underlying factor. It is not just another effort to plug a cause in a tragedy – a local researcher had indeed found that the ground on which the building stood was sinking albeit very slowly in the 1990s. Plus the sea levels have been rising in the area. 

To be sure, initial reports have hinted at potential structural faults and if they were repaired in time the tragedy that has claimed 11 lives (and about 150 are still missing) could have been averted. [https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/26/us/miami-building-collapse-investigation.html] Yet, that would only a partial explanation of the mishap, if the previous study by Shimon Wdowinski, environment professor at Florida International University is ignored. [https://edition.cnn.com/videos/us/2021/06/25/florida-building-collapse-shimon-wdowinski-gupta-intv-sot-vpx-nr.cnn]
 
Wdowinski used satellite data to measure the sinking of the land on which the building stood, and published his findings in a paper in 2020: that ground was sinking at a rate of 2 millimeters a year between 1993 and 1999. (The data is 20 years old, and he focused only on that plot; so the findings do not apply readily to nearby buildings.) 

More on his study:
https://news.fiu.edu/2021/fiu-professor-collapsed-surfside-building-showed-signs-of-subsidence-in-90s-era-space-radar-data

In addition, the sea levels around Miami rise at an average of 9 mm a year (which is three times the global average). Consider also the regular tides bringing seawater in, and these salty waters too impact the foundations of the buildings in the area, causing the metal parts to rust.

Not all buildings near the seaside are at imminent danger, and engineers would have already factored in some of the risks. Yet, climate change was not so well understood a couple of decades ago, and older seaside constructions should be subjected to regular assessments and retrofits. 

In the long run, the world is not prepared for the threat of rising sea levels, according to a 2019 report by Florida’s Rising Seas Institute in collaboration with the Institute of Mechanical Engineers of Britain.

So, this Meghdoot App is a joint effort of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and the Indian Council for Agriculture Research (ICAR) to bring high resolution weather forecast based agro-advisories to farmers in their own languages. There is useful information about rain prospects for farmers contextualized to the district and crop wise advisories twice a week. These advisories are originally issued by the Agro-Met Field Units (AMFU) but it is the Meghdoot App that actually allows farmers from across India to get information from these advisories, that too in a very user-friendly manner.

Not all, but several of the advisories are issued in regional languages. The main aim is to help farmers through the crop advisory. But this same App can also inform the farmers about the weather forecast and the observed weather. 

The Mausam App and the Damini App are respectively useful for knowing impeding weather events and lightning situations and getting alerts about these phenomena.

How urban gardens can boost biodiversity and make cities more sustainable,"In building cities, we have created some of the harshest habitats on Earth — and then chosen to live in them.

Temperatures in cities are typically 2-3 C warmer than those of the surrounding landscape. Pollution levels and noise can reach levels seen few other places on Earth. Too much drainage leaves soils dry in the heat, but the sealed surfaces of roads and sidewalks lead to flooding when it rains.

Because cities now house over 80 per cent of Canadians, their impact on the environment extends far beyond the city limits. Cities are now driving large-scale environmental changes such as elevated pollution levels, climate change and habitat loss.

We need to find solutions to creating more sustainable and functional cities. Part of the answer may lie in your garden.

Plants allow the city to sweat

The field of urban ecology is relatively new, but over the past three decades it has shed light on how green infrastructure — trees and other plants of greenspaces, gardens and wetlands — can offer solutions to the issues faced by urban development.

The few ecological studies done within cities prior to 1990 were based on isolated greenspaces. In the 1990s, there was a shift from studying ecology in cities towards studying the ecology of cities, where the entire city was seen as a coherent, functioning ecosystem, which led to the interdisciplinary field of urban ecology.

Urban ecology helps us understand how and why green infrastructure provides ecosystem services — the specific benefits provided by components of the ecosystem — that improve the livability and sustainability of urban areas.

For example, vegetation lowers the temperature of the city by 1 C to 9 C. This is not only a matter of providing shade — transpiration from the leaf surface area allows the city to sweat. Leaves also slow down raindrops, and roots allow rain to infiltrate the ground, reducing surface runoff. Further, the foliage traps particulate pollution and reduces noise.

Higher blood pressure means weaker immune system hence more Covid complications,"Question. What is the link between hypertension and negative impact of Covid 19 . Why is it considered one of the worse comorbidities?

Dr Nishith Chandra’s reply 

In the initial studies of COVID patients from Wuhan, China & Lombardy, Italy, it has been found that majority of patients, who developed severe critical illness, after COVID had high blood pressure. As the prevalence of HT increases in the elderly population, so are the other Co-Morbidities, which put the patients at higher risk of development of complications. Another controversy, related to HT and COVID was the use of some types of anti-HT medicines, like Angio Tension Receptor Blockers ( ARB) like Telmisartan, commonly used for HT. It was hypothesized inititally, that use of these ARB, might upregulate the expression of ACE2 receptors, facilitating the entry of virus inside the cells. But a number of studies conducted later have not found any association between use of ARB and increased incidence of COVID. So the guidelines are, that none of the anti HT medicines being used, have to be stopped in a COVID patient.

EXPLAINER 
you have high blood pressure, it's a good idea to take extra care to protect yourself during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. Early research shows that people with the condition may be more likely to:
Get COVID-19
Have worse symptoms

Why what’s the link ?

A weaker immune system is one reason people with high blood pressure and other health problems are at higher risk for coronavirus. Long-term health conditions and aging weaken your immune system so it's less able to fight off the virus. Nearly two-thirds of people over 60 have high blood pressure.","Health, covid 19, high blood pressure"

It is said that everything was going right for the AAP till Kejriwal decided to spend a night at the house of former Khalistan Commando Force (KCF) militant Gurinder Singh at Moga. 

The move triggered a political storm with both the ruling Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and the Congress launching an all out attack against the AAP.

SAD Chief and then Punjab Home Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) chief said the AAP embracing radicals was a dangerous signal for peace in Punjab.

Then Punjab Congress President and present Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh said Kejriwal’s AAP is a dangerous mix of extreme left and right ideologies that could plunge Punjab back into terrorism.

Then a powerful bomb blast took place in Maur Mandi town of Bhatinda district a few days before voting and in which seven people were killed and 25 wounded. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had attacked the AAP, alleging that Kejriwal was trying to back the perpetrators of the bomb blast in Punjab. 

Though the blast did not have any impact on the AAP's performance in that assembly segment as it won the Maur seat, the sudden surge in militant activities did hurt it's chances of coming to power in Punjab. 

Perhaps that was the AAP's best chance. It is said that many BJP and RSS supporters too voted in favour of the Congress, especially Amarinder, since they considered as their best bet in the given situation. 

So, will Kejriwal's promise help at a time when the farmers' issue is a key talking point in Punjab?","Politics, congress, punjab, arvind kejriwal, captain amarinder singh, aap, akali dal"

Climate explained: how the IPCC reaches scientific consensus on climate change,"Climate Explained is a collaboration between The Conversation, Stuff and the New Zealand Science Media Centre to answer your questions about climate change.

If you have a question you’d like an expert to answer, please send it to climate.change@stuff.co.nz

When we say there’s a scientific consensus that human-produced greenhouse gases are causing climate change, what does that mean? What is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and what do they do?

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) provides the world’s most authoritative scientific assessments on climate change. It provides policymakers with regular assessments of the scientific basis of climate change, its impacts and risks, and options for cutting emissions and adapting to impacts we can no longer avoid.

The IPCC has already released five assessment reports and is currently completing its Sixth Assessment (AR6), with the release of the first part of the report, on the physical science of climate change, expected on August 9.

Each assessment cycle brings together scientists from around the world and many disciplines. The current cycle involves 721 scientists from 90 countries, in three working groups covering the physical science basis (WGI), impacts, adaptation and vulnerability (WGII) and mitigation of climate change (WGIII).

In each assessment round, the IPCC identifies where the scientific community agrees, where there are differences of opinion and where further research is needed.

IPCC reports are timed to inform international policy developments such as the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) (First Assessment, 1990), the Kyoto Protocol (Second Assessment, 1995) and the Paris Agreement (Fifth Assessment, 2013-2014). The first AR6 report (WGI) will be released in August this year, and its approval meeting is set to take place virtually, for the first time in the IPCC’s 30-year history.

This will be followed by WGII and WGIII reports in February and March 2022, and the Synthesis Report in September 2022 — in time for the first UNFCCC Global Stocktake when countries will review progress towards the goal of the Paris Agreement to keep warming below 2℃.

During the AR6 cycle, the IPCC also published three special reports:

on global warming of 1.5℃ (2018)

on oceans and the cryosphere in a changing climate (2019)

on climate change and land (2019).

"Well, it's all about sense of history that you lack!","If you don't have a sense of history, your understanding of any sport is below par. 
Without historical understanding, watching a game is like well watching it to kill the time. But sporting rivalries are sublime, cathartic and go beyond watching a game for timepass. 

Well. Let me tell you what's happening between Germany and England on the pitch in last one decade or so.  

England fans won't want to remember the last time their team played Germany in a competitive fixture -- at the 2010 World Cup.

That match in Bloemfontein, South Africa, ended in a 4-1 Germany win, but, regardless of the result, events on that day would go on to change football forever.

The game will always be remembered for Frank Lampard's ""ghost goal"" which contributed to the introduction of goal-line technology in the modern game.

With the match poised at 2-1, the English midfielder thought he had equalized with a delightful chip over Manuel Neuer. Despite the ball quite clearly bouncing off the crossbar and over the line, the officials on the day did not see it and did not award the goal.

It caused outrage in England, forcing the game's governing bodies to apologize and paving the way for technology in the sport.","football, euro 2020"

England vs Germany is overhyped,"An England vs Germany football match is overhyped. 

Sure, it was a big thing years back, starting with the 1966 World Cup final with memories of the war still fresh and a TV revolution providing an unprecedented viewership. 

The rivalry peaked in 1990 with England's loss to a stereotypical cold and clinical Germans just before its unification. 

There were fears (unfounded) that when Germany became united, it would result in its football team becoming infallible. But when that did not happen, Germany’s neighbours relaxed. English hostility waned, just as Dutch-German and Franco-German football encounters also lost their edge.

British tabloids tried to keep the show going, with headlines like “ACHTUNG! SURRENDER!"" before the semi-final of Euro 96 at Wembley. But the papers had misjudged the mood with the headline caused much revulsion (England went on to lose). 

By 2010, when Germany beat England at the World Cup again, the ritual defeat was hardly traumatic at all. British fans had learnt to love the Germans. For most of them, Tuesday’s Euro 2020 match is a friendly affair.  

After decades of televised football,  emotions are less primal for international matches than before — even leaving aside the fact that this is a mere second-round match at a European Championship.

Even on the field, the multimillionaire English and German players, several of whom play for clubs in each other’s countries, will have more in common with their opponents than with their own fans.

England’s football rivalry with Germany has lost its teeth.","History, football"
Let's make momos delicious and nutritious,"Momos are love. The most delicious junk food that everyone wants to have on outings. The roadside stalls selling a plate of Momos are the most crowded stalls. The various fillings we get in that white bubble shaped ball, and with that the red chilli mix chutney is like a fireball. We can assume it as the red chilli chutney is like gunpowder which when dipped with momos make a shooter for your stomach. Although the spiciness and hotness of the Momos make this food super delicious, it is not good for stomach health. The burning sensation we feel after engulfing one is not good. Having this food every day or frequently in days or weeks or even in a month is not good for health. Besides the health concerns, the intake of any junk food is not advised. But it is Momos, how can you stop mouth watering. Moreover we are young so stopping us from anything we like the most is very difficult. But today's Youth are more concerned about their health, they are aware about what to take and what not. So there are various healthy ways to cook Momos. Having full vegetarian fillings. Using nutritional elements while cooking it. Especially while steaming, take care of overheating.  Overheating may become a cause of bad effects to your body. 


Keeping a check on your health and not compromising with delicious food is now possible. Healthy intake is possible with nutrition. Momos need flour to make the balls which are usually maida. Maida can be substituted with a mixture of rice flour with wheat flour. I guess this mixture may be a good replacement for the maida. And can give the same texture and moisture that we get with the use of maida. 


Moreover, there are more recipes of Momos that are nutritious. I hope I will get to share with you all the nutritious and delicious recipes of Momos or even you guys have some good recipes of Momos, do share with your support to this post. Let's try to spread different ways of cooking delicious junk foods. Shall we?","Food, Health, foodie, nutrition, momos"

How colonialism’s legacy makes harder for countries to escape poverty and fossil fuels today,"While fossil fuels were powering wealthy nations’ economic growth in the 19th and 20th centuries, many countries across the Global South remained largely impoverished.

Today, all that burning of oil, coal and natural gas has warmed the planet toward dangerous levels, and science shows that fossil fuel use must decline to slow climate change. At the same time, more than 40% of the global population survives on less than US$5.50 a day, primarily in developing countries.

Fossil fuels are still among the cheapest ways to power economic growth, making them hard for developing countries to ignore.

So, can we find a way to lift nearly half of the world out of poverty and still reduce fossil fuel use? As an environmental social scientist, I believe there can be no sustainable development, and likely no energy transition, if poverty is not addressed too. Current international efforts, like the chronically underfunded U.N. Green Climate Fund, whose board meets this week, aren’t doing enough.

Shadows of colonialism

The fact that nearly half the world’s population is still struggling to escape poverty while the thermometer’s mercury hurtles upward is not a coincidence.

Since the Age of Discovery, when European explorers began expanding trade and claiming colonies in the 1400s, problems of resource scarcity have been managed through colonial conquest and economic integration. These approaches impoverished Global South nations, robbing them of their natural wealth. The introduction of international financial institutions after World War II further locked them into a cycle of uneven exchange.

For hundreds of years the natural resources that southern nations exported to countries like Germany and the United States have been sold at a lower cost than the finished products they import for their own consumption. The result has been development in the Global North, destabilization and impoverishment in much of the Global South and climate change for all.

Fossil fuels have been a central element in development history because they have provided a cheap, mobile source of energy. They still predominantly boost wealthy countries’ growth.

Momos - King of Street Food,"My mind says 'abs' but my heart says 'momos'

I am sure most of you like Momos like I do but are they good for our health?
Momos have become the king of street food in the past decade in India. Easily available, portable and with no paraphernalia needed other than a steamer, they are much easy, and are cheap too.
Momo is a type of East and South Asian steamed filled dumpling. Momo is native to Tibet, Nepal, Bhutan, the Indian Himalayan Region of Ladakh, Sikkim, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Darjeeling. It is popular across a wider region of the Indian subcontinent. Momo is heavily influenced by Nepali cuisine with South Asian spices and herbs. Momo are extremely popular in Nepal and India and can be found in every kind of shop from restaurants to street vendors.
Momo are traditionally steamed but can also be deep fried or pan fried. Momo is usually served with chilli garlic sauce and pickled daikon in Tibet whereas in Nepal popular dipping sauces include tomato based chutneys or sesame based sauces, normally made with tomato as the base ingredient.
From the ingredients used to cook it to the way it is served and the condiments with which it is served, nothing really is healthy about this seemingly steamed-hence-healthy food.

Momos are made with maida which is the starchy part of the grain after the removal of its fibrous bran. Then, it is bleached with chemicals like Azodicarbonamide, chlorinegas, benzoyl peroxide, or other bleaches. Maida has also been suspected to contain traces of alloxans, a chemical that gives it the soft, refined texture.
Bleaching chemicals that are added to maida cause much harm to the pancreas, affecting its insulin-production ability. In fact, these bleaching agents are used to make diabetes occur in rodents for laboratory testing.
Alloxans are also harmful to pancreas and are responsible for causing insulin-dependent diabetes.
The vegetables and chicken used inside momos are stale or of a very poor standard.
One cannot be sure about the quality used by local momo-vendors. Also, an over-consumption of spicy foods is suspected to cause bleeding hemorrhoids.
So choose wisely what you want to eat and from where you want to eat as it plays an important role in maintaining your health.","Food, momos"

4. Khaki Files - Devil's Advocate: A convicted murderer who strutted around as he owned jail,"Devil’s Advocate continues ………….

I saw a person who suffered from dwarfism, whom I immediately recognized. He was Tantrey, member of a terrorist outfit we had busted when I was joint commissioner of the Special Cell of the Delhi Police. He was working on a sewing machine and it was amusing to see how he avoided making eye contact with me and pretended to focus on his job.

Another person I took note of was a tall, muscular, broad- shouldered middle-aged man with a spring in his gait, who walked several yards ahead of me and the jail staff escorting me. Dressed in a white shirt, white trousers and white canvas shoes, he strutted around as if he owned the jail. I took him to be a jail employee walking with me to provide security. Occasionally, he would tick off an inmate here and a jail warden there.

So taken up was I by his personality that I inquired of the jail superintendent who he was. The jail superintendent whispered in my ear that he was a convicted murderer. A little later, during my walk-around, out of sheer curiosity, I inquired, ‘Whose murder was he involved in?’

Someone from my entourage replied, ‘Sir, he killed an advocate.’

Though anxious to know more details, I restrained the urge to ask further questions and waited for an opportune moment.

I visited the living quarters—or wards—where inmates were lodged. Though overcrowded, they were reasonably neat and clean. After I spoke to a few inmates, I was taken to the jail kitchen, where chefs from amongst the inmates were cooking food for over a thousand fellow convicts. Much like what I had seen in the prison bakery, the cooks wore caps and gloves and went about their jobs in a clockwork fashion, churning out rotis on giant tawas at a frenetic pace. 

The superintendent requested me to taste the food and record my comments in the inspection register. A bite of roti taken with dal and sabzi tasted sublime. I dutifully recorded my complimentary inspection note, heaping praise on the prisoner chefs.

The garments made by the inmates were novel in their design and of excellent quality. It looked like a fashion outlet in busy Karol Bagh, except for the absence of milling crowds.

Then there was the next big surprise: the prison bakery. I entered the huge baking hall and found the prisoners wearing white chef’s hats, transparent gloves and face masks, skillfully kneading dough, cutting out cookies, stuffing patties and baking bread, pastries and cakes. 

The floor of the hall was spotless, and the machines and utensils shining clean. I thought to myself that the standards of hygiene here would easily put to shame those of the best restaurants and five-star hotels of the city! I was informed that all products made in the jail premises were retailed under the brand name TJ’s (Tihar Jail’s) and the brand had an impressive turnover with the potential to rise manifold. It was pleasing to know that every inmate was paid a daily wage, which they could spend on themselves or send home for the upkeep of their family.

I next visited the library, painting studio, hair salon and a medical room. I also saw convicts playing cricket in white flannels in a reasonably sized, open-air stadium. Someone in my entourage informed me that the jail had a well-established team called Tihar 11, which played club-level matches with outside teams.

The preconceived notion of a prison, with convicts in their striped black and white uniforms hammering at rocks, controlled by ruthless jail staff, disappeared. The place felt more like a retreat, an ashram—a serene expanse of tranquillity and peace.

I also ran into convicts whom I recognized from my long years in the Delhi Police and the CBI. Many had been arrested by police teams working under me.

France have only kept one clean sheet in their last ten EURO final tournament knockout phase matches.

Switzerland had lost all three of their competitive penalty shoot-outs before tonight.

The Nati had scored eight goals across four EURO final tournaments prior to this year – they have netted seven so far at EURO 2020.

Seferović became the second Swiss player to score in consecutive EURO finals games after Hakan Yakin in 2008.

Switzerland have won all bar two of their matches when Seferović has scored for them (W16 D1 L1).

The last time Switzerland were successful in a final tournament knockout phase match before this game was back in the 1938 World Cup.","france, euro"
Book review :Hickory Dickory Dock,"Genre: Murder mystery

Hercule Poirot is back with his immaculate moustache and Belgian accent. In his world - order and routine reign supreme, so when his highly efficient assistant Ms. Lemon makes not one - but three typing errors, he takes it upon himself to bring back order.

He is called down to the students hostel at the end of Hickory Road by the sweet bubbly caretaker Ms. Hubbard (Ms. Lemon’s sister) when she finds various items missing and vandalized.

She assumes it to be just some cruel joke until Hercule Poirot steps in and calls it “a unique and beautiful problem.”

And this changes the entire story.
He takes one look at the list of bizarre and yet unseeming random list of items that were stolen and vandalized - a stethoscope, some lightbulbs, some old flannel trousers, a box of chocolates, a slashed rucksack, some boracic powder and a diamond ring .

He knows something is amiss in Dickory road. Something much bigger than petty thefts and robberies.


Hickory Dickory Dock is a very classic detective novel with an interesting twist. A nice light read.

The storyline focuses on character build-up which I thoroughly enjoyed. The ending was mildly surprising.

I really enjoyed the unique nuances of Hercule Poirot.

Hercule Poirot is a household name in the works of Agatha Christie.

I also enjoyed reading the Murder on the Orient Express which was a good brain teaser and a truly captivating murder mystery.

Florida condo collapse – searching for answers about what went wrong in Surfside,"The collapse of a huge condominium building near Miami, Florida was shocking news to wake up to on the morning of June 24, 2021. It is one of the worst building collapses in recent U.S. history.

I am a professor of engineering and have been studying structural failures – and the lessons people learn from them – for about 25 years. My colleagues and I from the American Society of Civil Engineers and the American Concrete Institute will be studying this tragedy to figure out what lessons we might learn.

How does a building stand for 40 years and then collapse, perhaps with little or no warning? Why did it collapse so that part of the building stayed up, sparing many lives? It might take months or longer for engineers to find answers to these questions. But those reports, when they do come, are important because engineers can use them to improve building codes and other safety measures – and hopefully prevent future collapses.

The conditions that make a building weak could be design errors, construction errors or corrosion. In this case, 40 years of corrosive ocean air may have degraded steel, concrete and other materials. Triggers can be natural events – like an earthquake or a tornado – or man-made like a bomb or collision.

So why, after standing 40 years, did the building in Florida collapse?

To look for clues about the condition of a building, engineers often start by reviewing all available records. In this case, the town of Surfside, Florida, quickly released a number of key documents for the public to access. These include the building plans from 1979 and a nine page report documenting a structural field survey carried out in 2018. It is unusual for engineers to get a field survey report because these usually aren’t done or are only provided to the owner. It will probably prove very useful in understanding the building’s condition before the collapse.

And the trigger? As I write this, no one yet knows what event caused the collapse. The key evidence is likely still buried under the rubble.

Saudi retail magnate lists 432 Park pad for $170M,"Saudi retail magnate Fawaz Alhokair is shopping his lofty penthouse at 432 Park Avenue with a sky-high price tag.

The founder and chairman of Saudi-based hospitality and entertainment conglomerate Fawaz Alhokair Group has listed his penthouse at the tower for $170 million, according to the Wall Street Journal. Celebrity broker Ryan Serhant is handling the listing.

Alhokair paid $87.7 million for the six-bedroom pad, which is the highest unit in the supertall tower, in 2016. Notably, the property’s co-developer, CIM Group, provided him with a $56 million loan that covered nearly two-thirds of the purchase price. He went into contract on the unit in 2013. The deal was the most expensive in the tower at the time.

If Alhokair finds a buyer willing to pay near $170 million, it will be among the most expensive sales ever in the city. The record for the priciest transaction in New York City, and the country, was Ken Griffin’s $238 million purchase of a quadplex at 220 Central Park South. More recently, a buyer shelled out $157.5 million to purchase two units also at 220 Central Park South.

But over the years residents have inhabited 432 Park, which was briefly the tallest residential tower in the Western Hemisphere, concerns have grown about plumbing and mechanical issues in the building. Elevator problems, leaks and noisy creaking walls are some of the issues residents have raised with the developers, CIM and Macklowe Properties, according to the New York Times.
Before the pandemic swept through the U.S., Alhokair bought a $94 million spec mansion in Los Angeles from developer Bruce Makowsky. Alhokair’s companies lost about $200 million last year in part because of pandemic restrictions on retail stores, according to a Reuters’ report.

NFL: Football is gay. Football is queer. Football is for everyone.,"Shortly after National Football League’s Carl Nassib became the first player to come out as gay, the NFL released a call to action ‘Football is Gay’ video, directing viewers to join them in supporting Trevor Project, a mental health organization for LGBTQI+ youth. 

The video released Monday, starts with a matte black background and drumroll continuing to the beat of capitalized, bold white-letter words, claps and cheers: 

""Football is gay. Football is lesbian. Football is beautiful. Football is queer. Football is life. Football is exciting. Football is culture. Football is transgender. Football is queer. Football is heart. Football is power. Football is tough. Football is bisexual. Football is strong. Football is freedom. Football is American. Football is accepting. Football is everything. Football is for everyone."" 

The risk of suicide for LGBTQI+ youth reduces by 40 percent with at least one accepting adult, the video goes on to cite. 

“If you love this game, you are welcome here. Football is for all. Football is for everyone.. The NFL stands by the LGBTQ+ community today and every day,” NFL tweeted. 

In his coming out video, Nassib mentioned he’s donating $100,000 to the Trevor Project.

What are tax havens? The answer explains why the G-7 effort to end them is unlikely to succeed,"Close your eyes and imagine a tax haven. Does a Caribbean island come to mind? Sand, surf and thousands of post office boxes housing shell corporations?

Some tax havens, like the Cayman Islands or Bermuda, fit that description. Many others do not.

The key to a tax haven is the taxes, not the tan. Any place that allows a taxpayer – whether an individual or a company – to get a lower tax bill overseas than at home is a tax haven. Thus, depending on the taxpayer’s jurisdiction and business, many places turn out to be tax havens, even the United States.

A recent agreement by the Group of Seven wealthy nations seeks to eliminate corporate tax havens by imposing a global 15% minimum corporate tax rate. However, as a tax expert, I find the effort hard to take seriously.

3 things that make a tax haven a tax heaven

Put simply, tax havens are jurisdictions that offer low or even no taxes in a bid to attract foreign investment.

From a taxpayer’s perspective, the first sign of a good tax haven is that it’s completely legal. While there may be a perception that people who use tax havens to lower their tax bills are breaking the law, that’s rarely the case.

A taxpayer who is comfortable doing that does not need a tax haven. Instead, a dishonest accountant and a less honest banker are all that’s required.

The second sign of a good tax haven is transparency, political stability and rule of law. If it costs more in lawyers, accountants and bribes to avoid taxes overseas than it costs to pay the tax at home, there is no point to a tax haven.

The third sign is privacy. For many years, Swiss banks provided the gold standard in that regard by refusing to reveal anything about their depositors to anyone. That changed in 2008, when Swiss banks agreed to report on their depositors to 43 European countries.

The loss of the complete secrecy that Switzerland once provided has made shell companies – and the countries that make them easy to set up – much more attractive

What a match! world champion France crash out of Euro 2020,"Switzerland stunned reigning world champion France with victory in a nerve-shredding penalty shootout to book its place in the Euro 2020 quarterfinals.

Kylian Mbappe, who endured a torrid night leading the line for France, capped a miserable evening by missing his team's decisive fifth penalty, the only player not to score in the shootout.

It was scarcely believable the tie had even reached this stage, as Switzerland trailed 3-1 with less than 10 minutes of regulation time remaining.

However, late goals from Haris Seferovic and Mario Gavranovic stunned their French opponents as Switzerland forced extra-time.

France looked like it was cruising after Karim Benzema's brace and Paul Pogba's stunning long-range strike had canceled out Seferovic's early header, with Switzerland's Ricardo Rodriguez missing what looked like a crucial penalty in the second half.

In the end, it mattered little as Switzerland advanced to face Spain in Friday's quarterfinal.","football, euro 2020"
PepsiCo's AI creates products you didn't know you wanted,"PepsiCo uses AI technology to create products that customers didn't even know they wanted. Its Tastewise tool analyzes over 95M menu items, 226B recipe interactions, and 22.5B social media posts to understand what customers want and why.
This helped PepsiCo develop its bestselling seaweed-flavored snack, marketed as Off The Eaten Path. Another AI-based tool, Trendscope, analyzes social media interactions around food to understand upcoming food trends.

PepsiCo's Trendscope AI tool helped determine that people were interested in immunity-boosting products amid the pandemic. This ""social prediction"" led to the launch of its Propel sports drinks infused with immunity ingredients.

When will we know more about results in NYC’s mayoral race?,"Almost a week after election night in New York City’s Democratic mayoral primary, it remains unknown who the winner is.

But while little has changed in the six days since Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams took a healthy lead in first-choice votes, New Yorkers can expect the foggy picture to grow somewhat clearer on Tuesday.

As of last week, when in-person results first emerged, Adams had received 31.7% of the first-place vote, Maya Wiley had captured 22.3% and Kathryn Garcia had scored 19.5%.

The Board of Elections said it expects to release its first report of ranked-choice results on Tuesday, running the elimination rounds that pick a winner in the new system.

Valerie Vazquez-Diaz, a spokesperson for the Board of Elections, said on Monday morning that it wasn’t yet clear what time the new tables will be reported on Tuesday.

The winner of the primary will take on Curtis Sliwa, the Republican victor, in the general election.

For the latest numbers, take a look at the Daily News’ live 2021 NYC Primary Election Results Tracker.

Here’s what we do know about the official election results timeline, according to VOTE.NYC

June 29: Preliminary RCV round-by-round elimination will not include absentee and affidavit ballots (report 1) and the last day for the Board of Elections to receive an absentee ballot.

July 6: Preliminary RCV round-by-round elimination (report 2)

The first slate of results — which will be calculated with digital software — is expected to reveal who won the race based on in-person ballots cast on Primary Day and in the early voting period. The results could still change when absentee votes are counted. (Those ballots can continue to stream in until Tuesday, and another release of results is expected on July 6 with some absentee votes.)

In the ranked-choice system, when the candidate with the fewest votes is knocked out, voters who selected him or her as their top choice have their second-choice votes distributed to the remaining hopefuls. The process repeats until only two contenders remain. At that point, the candidate with more votes wins.

This is what football fans live for! The adrenaline rush from every cross inside the 30 yards. The palpitation from every tackle inside the penalty box.

The truth is, Croatia almost won the match till their tired legs gave out at extra time and Morata scored the final nail. 
Croatia fought with their heart and soul to keep the scoreline 3-3 at the end of 90 minutes. 

When France were leading 3-1 till 80 minutes, I wondered, wouldn't it be absolute bonkers if Switzerland were to somehow score two goals within 10 minutes?

They heard my thoughts, probably. As I was holding the Swiss cheese of hope in my mind, Switzerland slapped the World Champions for two goals and took the game to penalties, and they beat France!

Good Samaritan stabbed inside Staten Island ferry terminal defending woman from drunken man,"A man on his first fun outing to Manhattan since the start of the coronavirus pandemic wound up stabbed by a drunken stranger angered that he told him to knock off harassing women inside Staten Island’s ferry terminal.

Dylan Spinosa, 20, of Staten Island, was waiting for a cab home from the St. George terminal with three friends about 8:45 p.m. on Sunday when they encountered the stabber after a day visiting Times Square and stopping by the Pride march.

He was “harassing every girl that he passed by, talking to them sexually,” Spinosa told the Daily News on Monday.

Spinosa and a stranger urged the harasser to cut it out and head home. The creep, who claimed to have a gun and was holding a beer can, retreated briefly but then went back to making unwanted advances on a passerby.

“He was in her ear, sexually harassing her, saying he was going to have sex with her,” Spinosa said. “Me and this other guy were like, ‘Dude, leave her alone. Go home. You’re drunk. This doesn’t have to get any further.’ ”



“I just felt bad for the woman because she was walking away and saying, ‘Please stop,’ ” he added.

The enraged assailant punched the stranger in the face, knocking him to the ground, and Spinosa stepped in and put the attacker in a headlock.

When he thought things had cooled down, Spinosa went to get water for the stranger when he heard one of his startled friends scream.

“I turn around and the guy’s charging us,” Spinosa said of the assailant. “I didn’t realize that he had a knife. It felt like he punched me. I thought he threw a beer on me.”

The liquid he felt dripping down his back turned out to be blood.

Trump can still draw a crowd — just like a lot of oldies acts,"Donald Trump’s weekend rally in Wellington, Ohio, shows the former president still has drawing power. But so do old rock bands whose nostalgia tours pack stadiums while their new releases don’t chart.
Trump won’t really face the music until next summer, when the Republican incumbents he is trying to unseat are up for reelection. He went to Ohio explicitly for this purpose — specifically, to bash Rep. Anthony Gonzalez (R), who voted for impeachment, and tout Gonzalez’s primary challenger, former Trump aide Max Miller. If you were to look solely at crowd size, you’d think Gonzalez is toast.
Look closer, though, and you can start to see the shopworn, out-of-tune elements to Trump’s shtick. Trump’s speech fixated on his lie that the 2020 presidential election was stolen rather than on any current issues. He continues to emphasize his old positions and grievances rather than lead or even comment on what’s going on today. It’s always a bad sign when a politician has nothing new to say.
Polling also shows Trump’s influence is eroding among Republicans. The GOP polling firm Echelon Insights conducts a monthly national poll and has tracked since mid-2020 whether Republican voters say they are more of a Trump supporter or more of a party backer. In October of last year, 59 percent of Republicans said they were more of a Trump supporter, while only 30 percent said they were primarily a Republican. That’s now flipped: This month, 53 percent of respondents said they were primarily a Republican, while only 38 percent said they were more of a Trump backer.
This steady erosion in the intensity of Trump’s support is a problem for him. The fall news will likely be dominated by Republican opposition to President Biden’s agenda. Trump’s constant replaying of his golden oldies adds nothing meaningful to that, ceding the field to others. Each of the people he has targeted will almost certainly be vocal in their opposition to Biden and the progressives. By next year’s primaries, they will have shown conservatives in their districts that they can be counted on to fight for their priorities.

Canada sets record temperature of almost 116 degrees amid heat wave,"Lytton, a village in British Columbia, became the first place in Canada to ever record a temperature over 113 degrees Fahrenheit on Sunday — and experts are predicting even hotter weather to come.
The temperature in Lytton soared to just under 116 degrees Sunday, according to Environment Canada, a government weather agency.
As The Washington Post’s Capital Weather Gang noted, that is just one degree lower than the city record in Las Vegas. The previous Canadian records for hottest temperature, both 113 degrees, were set in Yellow Grass and Midale in Saskatchewan on July 5, 1937.
“It’s warmer in parts of western Canada than in Dubai. I mean, it’s just not something that seems Canadian,” Environment Canada senior climatologist David Phillips told CTV News on Saturday.
In the metropolitan hub of Vancouver, parks, beaches and pools have been flooded with residents eager to cool off as the temperature hit 89 degrees at the local airport Sunday — a record in a coastal city that usually has mild weather.
Canada’s record comes amid a severe heat wave in the Pacific Northwest, with records of 112 degrees in Portland, Ore., and 103 degrees in Seattle.

Lytton’s record may not stand for long. In a tweet, Environment Canada suggested that as more readings from Sunday come in, further records could be set.
And the heat wave is expected to continue for several more days. CTV News reported that predictions for Tuesday suggest Lytton could reach almost 117 degrees.

The high temperatures in the region have been blamed on a “heat dome,” a sprawling area of high pressure, now sitting over western Canada and the Pacific Northwest. Experts say climate change can make extreme weather events like this more common.
Air conditioning is not standard in British Columbia, and Canadian outlets reported that locals were having a hard time finding air conditioners and fans over the weekend.
Environment Canada has issued heat warnings for a variety of people, including young children, pregnant women, the elderly and those with chronic illnesses.

Court dismisses FTC antitrust complaint against Facebook,"A district court in D.C. on Monday dismissed the Federal Trade Commission’s antitrust complaint against Facebook, saying the agency had failed to offer enough facts to prove Facebook has monopoly power in the social media industry.
The court said the agency could file an amended complaint with more details to bolster its case. But the judge voiced outright skepticism that Facebook is a monopoly, calling that “conventional wisdom"" for which the FTC had offered no evidence.
“It is almost as if the agency expects the Court to simply nod to the conventional wisdom that Facebook is a monopolist,” District Judge James E. Boasberg wrote in his opinion.
The decision immediately sparked reaction from both sides of the dispute, with those favoring action against Big Tech calling for a rewrite of antitrust law, which requires a showing that a company is a monopoly before a case can be pursued.
“Today’s development in the FTC’s case against Facebook shows that antitrust reform is urgently needed,” Ken Buck, the top Republican on the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee, tweeted. “Congress needs to provide additional tools and resources to our antitrust enforcers to go after Big Tech companies engaging in anticompetitive conduct.”
Facebook’s defenders extolled the decision.
“Today’s decision by the D.C. District Court reinforces what every American already knows, that there is robust choice and competition online and on social media,” said Carl Szabo, vice president and general gounsel at NetChoice, which counts Facebook as a member. “Activists might say we need new antitrust laws, but the Federal Trade Commission’s departure from tradition into subjective antitrust enforcement has illustrated the very need for our laws to continue to be applied objectively and fairly.”
The court also dismissed a similar lawsuit brought by a group of state attorneys general against the company that challenged the company’s acquisitions of photo-sharing service Instagram and messaging app WhatsApp. The court ruled that the states waited too long to challenge Facebook’s acquisition of the companies in 2012 and 2014, respectively.

"New York Yankees Stink, And There’s Plenty Of Blame To Go Around","Dec. 1, 2017 was one of my craziest days during a 1.5-year stint on the New York Yankees’ beat. It started with an early-morning train ride from Grand Central to Stamford, Conn., and ended with a late-night cab ride from Barclays Center to my apartment. 

In-between, Brian Cashman declared before his annual building repel that he was all-in on trying to land two-way phenom Shohei Ohtani — considered the “Babe Ruth of Japan.” And what was supposed to be a relaxing evening watching hockey with a friend in Brooklyn quickly turned into texting with colleague Bill Madden and sources from the concourse — and writing much of the main news story on my phone before leaving the game early — as the Yankees finalized a deal to make Aaron Boone their next manager.

That day came to mind again on Sunday, with the Yankees in complete and utter disarray and Ohtani’s Los Angeles Angels set to visit for a three-game series in The Bronx. Right now, Ohtani is the best player in baseball, and the Bombers could certainly use him. But it’s not like they didn’t try. The Yankees did literally everything they could — as per CBA rules — to make it happen. 

Of course, it still remains shocking that they didn’t even get to make an in-person pitch (Cashman was feeling pessimistic later on Dec. 1, 2017 before receiving official word two days later). Yet the Bombers weren’t allowed to flex their financial muscles. They weren’t allowed to offer $200-300 million. No team was. Granted, even if they had, Ohtani probably would’ve still said no. He wasn’t interested in New York. And given the way that he’s playing, it’s impossible to say that he made the wrong choice — even though he’d probably prefer to be in the playoff race. 

Ohtani, now 26, started off his career by winning AL Rookie of the Year in 2018 before injuries hampered him in 2019-20. In February, he signed a two-year, $8.5 million deal. He’s arbitration-eligible in 2023, and can becoming a free agent in 2024.

Trump Suing New York Over a Golf Course,"Former president Donald Trump had a contract with the city of New York to operate a golf course in the Bronx. He claims that he spent $30 million on a new clubhouse, restaurant and large pro shop. But just as he was about to open the renovated facility, he found himself on the receiving end of a peremptory “You’re fired!” The city’s mayor, Bill de Blasio (D), canceled the contract, saying that because of Trump’s conduct on Jan. 6, when a mob of his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol, the course was no longer a “first-class, tournament-quality course.” In short, the city determined that Trump had become too toxic to run a golf club.

In retaliation, Trump is suing New York. Litigation was the former president’s way of doing business for decades, but now he has criminal exposure to consider because of his recent actions.

Trump's big lie about 2020 results suffers legal and political blows in key swing states,"CNN)It was a bad week for the Big Lie -- former President Donald Trump and his allies' false claims that widespread fraud is to blame for his 2020 election loss.

In one battleground state, Republican senators issued a report that eviscerated Trump's lies about voter fraud. In another, a judge undercut Trump's supporters' hopes to examine nearly 150,000 mail-in ballots. And one of Trump's closest allies, Rudy Giuliani, was suspended from practicing law in New York.

Trump and his conspiracy-minded supporters have eagerly been anticipating the conclusion of the problem-plagued audit of Maricopa County's results in Arizona, but regardless of its final report, it will have no impact on the 2020 election results, as the election was already certified. Trump repeated his election lies at a rally in Ohio Saturday night, but last week's blows underscored the reality that their options to continue contesting the 2020 election are narrowing.

In Michigan, the Republican-led state Senate Oversight Committee said in a report released Wednesday that there was ""no evidence of widespread or systematic fraud"" in the state's 2020 election. The report included a stinging condemnation of the lies about voter fraud pushed by Trump and his supporters.

""Our clear finding is that citizens should be confident the results represent the true results of the ballots cast by the people of Michigan,"" the committee, chaired by Republican state Sen. Ed McBroom, said in its report. ""The Committee strongly recommends citizens use a critical eye and ear toward those who have pushed demonstrably false theories for their own personal gain.""

Then, in Georgia on Thursday, a judge dismissed most of a lawsuit that claimed fraudulent mail-in ballots had been cast in Fulton County, the state's largest county, in last year's election -- a blow to the pro-Trump plaintiffs' bid to conduct an in-person examination of nearly 150,000 mail-in ballots with high-powered microscopes.

The judge dismissed seven of the lawsuit's nine claims against Fulton County officials, only allowing the plaintiffs' request for digital images of the ballots under the state's open records law to move forward. Biden won the state by 12,000 votes, and Georgia officials have already audited the 2020 results three times, including a hand recount.

Food Fear,"Food is always demonized. In the nineties it was salt (let me tell you, the UK still hasn’t gotten over that one), but that’s not the only one. Salt, carbs, dairy, and even fruit and its natural sugars have all taken a turn in societal time-out. Start scrolling on any food corner of social media and you can’t escape the influencers promoting the keto diet, which cuts huge swathes out of food groups. “Avoid this for your health,” someone says, or “Eat this, not that,” or, my personal favorite, “Your intake of oil or avocado at dinner should only be the size of your fingernail."" Um, what? I eat half an avocado at a time, minimum.
 
This is harmful on multiple levels. First, this kind of health-nut fear-mongering fosters a bad relationship with food. It promotes both fatphobia and eating disorders. In addition to that, diets are dishonest. Keto, for instance, will help you lose weight—but too fast, too unhealthily, and temporarily. It stops as soon as you stop the diet, and it’s not sustainable forever.
 
“But my doctor said I need to lose weight!” you say. Maybe. But weight is the result of a lot of factors, not just your diet. (And doctors can be fatphobic, too, but that’s another post.) Attaching food to fear does nothing but harm.
 
I remember eating lunch near a group of women in their forties while I was at work. They all had paper plates full of shredded lettuce, tomatoes, and cucumbers. They talked for half an hour about how much they missed cheese and salad dressing but they didn’t want to eat it and be “bad.”
 
I bit my tongue, but what I really wanted to say was, “Eat the cheese and ranch! Stop telling yourself or anyone else that they’re bad for eating anything!”
 
The food you eat says nothing about your morals, or your shortcomings, or anything about you as a person. Eat what you like. Eat what makes you feel good. Don’t worry if it makes you “good” or “bad.” And ignore anyone who tells you otherwise.","Food, cooking, diet, eating disorder"

Climate change: Courts set for rise in compensation cases,"There's likely to be a significant increase in the number of lawsuits brought against fossil fuel companies in the coming years, say researchers.

Their new study finds that to date, lawyers have failed to use the most up-to-date scientific evidence on the cause of rising temperatures.

As a result, there have been few successful claims for compensation.

That could change, say the authors, as evidence linking specific weather events to carbon emissions increases.

So far, around 1,500 climate-related lawsuits have been brought before the courts around the world.

There have been some notable successes for environmental groups, such as in a recent case against Shell decided by a civil court in the Netherlands.

The judge ruled that, by 2030, the company must cut its CO2 emissions by 45% compared to 2019 levels.

The verdict also indicated that the Shell group is responsible for its own CO2 emissions and those of its suppliers.

However, there have been few successes in cases where the plaintiffs have sought compensation for damages caused by climate change linked to human activity.

This new study has assessed some 73 lawsuits across 14 jurisdictions and says that the evidence presented to the courts lagged significantly behind the most recent climate research.

Over the past two decades, scientists have attempted to demonstrate the links between extreme weather events and climate change, which are in turn connected to human activities such as energy production and transport.

These studies, called attribution science, have become more robust over the years.

For example, researchers have been able to show that climate change linked to human activities made the European summer heatwave in 2019 both more likely and more intense

A recent paper on Hurricane Sandy - the deadly storm that wreaked havoc from the Caribbean to New York in 2012 - showed that climate change was responsible for about 13% of the $62bn in losses caused by the event.

How Microsoft is taking on Apple on a new front now,"Augmented and virtual reality market is set to grow at a fast pace in the coming years and the two tech giants-Apple and Microsoft are keeping their ammunition dry while not giving up on short-term skirmishes

One that is being discussed now is how Microsoft has taken a swipe at Apple by allowing developers in the new Windows 11 app store to use third-party payment apps and charging 0% commission to those who do. This is in sharp contrast to Apple's policy of payment being made only through its system and also charging 30% of the fee that the apps on its App store earn. Steve Jobs positioned Apple as the company that was opposed to HP and claimed that it was anti-Microsoft. Now Microsoft may be positioning itself as anti-Apple. [https://www.imore.com/microsoft-just-turned-screw-app-store-allowing-third-party-commerce-its-store]

According to the observers of the tech marketplace, the slew of additional measures that Microsoft announced at the launch of Windows 11, could also keep in mind the antitrust probe that it faces from the EU and others.

Although the relations between Apple and Microsoft were cordial for many years, they have taken a nasty turn in recent years, especially after Jobs' death.

The last serious clash was over Microsoft's opposition to Apple's app store. Accusing it of being anti competitive, it complained to the regulators. It sided with Epic Games Inc., which sued Apple for booting its Fornite title from the App Store.

Microsoft President Brad Smith had accused Apple of imposing requirements that ""increasingly say there is only one way to get on to our platform and that is to go through the gate that we ourselves have created.""

Apple is unlikely to take things lying down. The battles between the two giants may get ugly.

Pak Interior Minister admits country hosting Taliban families,"Islamabad : Pakistan has for long completely rejected assertions of having Taliban footprints on its soil. However, incumbent Interior Minister Sheikh Rasheed Ahmed has admitted that Islamabad not only hosts families of the Taliban, but it also is aware of fighters getting medical treatment in the country.

Ahmed, well known for his outspoken attitude, has admitted that families of Taliban fighters reside in the country and many of the group’s members receive medical treatment in local hospitals.

In an interview to a local television network, the Minister said many of those familiesreside in the surrounding areas Pakistan’s capital Islamabad.

“Taliban families live here, in Pakistan, in Rawat, Loi Ber, Bara Kahu and Tarnol areas. Sometimes their (fighters) dead bodies arrive and sometimes they come here in hospital to get medical treatment,” he added.

Ahmed’s admission bcompletely negates Islamabad’s outright rejection of allegations leveled by Kabul and Washington that Taliban terrorists use Pakistani soil to direct and sustain their activities in Afghanistan.

On the other hand, Pakistan has counter-blamed Afghanistan for facilitating militants and other illegal movements from its 2,600 km-long open border into Pakistan.

Pakistan has also maintained that it facilitates about three million Afghan refugees for decades, which at times does serve as a hiding place for the Taliban insurgents.

Recently, the Pakistan Foreign Office had categorically rejected the remarks of the Press Office of the Afghan Minister of Foreign Affairs, regarding activities of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in Afghanistan.

“The assertion of the Afghan side are contrary to facts on ground and various reports of the UN, which also corroborate the presence and activities of over 5000-strong TTP in Afghanistan”” said the Pakistan Foreign Office.

William Barr’s bombshell about Trump is more revealing than it seems,"Having gone to extraordinary lengths to help Donald Trump corrupt the presidency, William P. Barr is working overtime to launder his post-Trump reputation. But the former attorney general’s latest cleanup exercise may end up showing that the stain of his corruption is even darker than we thought — in a way that soils other Republicans as well.
Barr has offered fresh details about Trump’s effort to subvert the election to journalist Jonathan Karl. These are supposed to be exonerating. But they open up new lines of inquiry about the post-election conduct of Barr himself, and show that the machinations of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) are more depraved than we knew.
Barr’s main revelation concerns his break with Trump on Dec. 1, when Barr publicly declared that the Justice Department had not seen election fraud “on a scale” that would have changed the outcome. This enraged Trump.
Several weeks before, in early November, Barr had taken the extraordinary step of authorizing U.S. attorneys to open election fraud investigations. The move attracted scalding criticism — the department had long refrained from such investigations until results are certified, to avoid this very sort of politicization.
Barr is now claiming he always knew the fraud claims were nonsense. As he told Karl, “my suspicion all the way"" was that they were ""all bulls--t.”
And there’s this:
Barr told me he had already concluded that it was highly unlikely that evidence existed that would tip the scales in the election…He also knew that at some point, Trump was going to confront him about the allegations, and he wanted to be able to say that he had looked into them and that they were unfounded.
But this isn’t exonerating in the least. Barr is unintentionally admitting that he ordered a highly controversial change in department policy — one designed to insulate the department from getting drawn into disputes over election outcomes — even though he had already concluded there was no basis to the election fraud claims.

"SC will not hear transgender bathroom rights dispute, a win for Va. student who sued school","The Supreme Court declined to hear a legal battle over the rights of transgender students on Monday, handing a victory to Gavin Grimm over the Virginia school board that denied him the right to use the boys’ restroom.
As is its custom, the court did not say why it was rejecting the appeal of the Gloucester County school district. Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. said they would have accepted the case.
The court’s decision not to take up the case does not establish a national precedent, nor does it signal agreement with the lower court.
Legal battles involving transgender rights are being fought in lower courts, and the Supreme Court often lets such issues percolate before weighing in. A direct split among the regional appeals courts is often what prompts the justices to enter the debate.
In a 2-to-1 decision last August, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit said the school board had practiced sex-based discrimination and violated the 14th Amendment by prohibiting Grimm, a transgender student, from using the bathroom that aligned with his gender identity. His high school offered a single-stall restroom as an alternative.

Judge Henry F. Floyd wrote that the 4th Circuit, which covers Virginia, Maryland, West Virginia and the Carolinas, was joining “a growing consensus of courts” finding that the Constitution and federal law protects transgender students “from school bathroom policies that prohibit them from affirming their gender.”

Floyd framed the case in historical terms.

“The proudest moments of the federal judiciary have been when we affirm the burgeoning values of our bright youth, rather than preserve the prejudices of the past,” Floyd wrote. “How shallow a promise of equal protection that would not protect Grimm from the fantastical fears and unfounded prejudices of his adult community. It is time to move forward.”
Floyd’s ruling quoted the Supreme Court’s landmark victory for gay and transgender workers last June, which said a federal law forbidding discrimination protects sexual orientation and gender identity.

Fake ‘love jihad’ rate list putting price tag on non-Muslim women revived on social media,"By Arjun Sidharth

An alleged rate list with a price tag put on non-Muslim women with an exhortation to lure them and convert them to Islam is circulating on social media. The price ranges from Rs. 6 lakh for a Hindu Brahmin girl to Rs. 3 lakh for a Jain girl and Rs. 7 lakh for a Sikh girl.

Twitter handle ‘Santani Kids’ tweeted an image of what appears to be an extract from the newspaper, Sanjha Lokswami, which advertised the same ‘rate card’ writing, “लड़की भगाओ मुस्लिम बनाओ और इनाम पाओ” (Elope with a girl, convert her to Islam and gain a reward).

The ‘rate card’ has been making the rounds on social media for quite sometime now. Last year, it was shared by Facebook group PROUD HINDU with the caption, “Shocking document. Love jihad is real. Save our Hindu daughters. Sponsored by PFI.”

On August 4, 2018, actor Koena Mitra Mitra had tweeted the alleged Sanjha Lokswami newspaper clipping. Mitra’s account remains permanently suspended by Twitter as of now.

Mischievous, photoshopped image
The image tweeted by Mitra is photoshopped, and this particular message has been circulating on social media and on WhatsApp for several years now. Alt News found that the earliest version of this dangerous provocation is on a blog titled ‘Sikh and Islam’ published on February 5, 2010. There are a number of clues in the image posted below which prove that it is fake.

Firstly, this poster has the phrase, “in the name of allah……most merciful, most benificiary“, while the usual phrase used is “In the Name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful“. Such a mistake would be unusual if this had actually been a pamphlet issued by an Islamic organisation. Moreover, it is the heart-shaped image at the top of the pamphlet that gives the most concrete evidence of this poster being a photoshopped one. The gun-shaped image within the heart is actually the flag of Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shi’a Islamist militant group. The heart-shaped image has been independently in circulation since 2006.

What can we do about period poverty?,"Period poverty is a serious problem. Across the world, people of all ages lack access to their basic period needs, and even more have to deal with “luxury tax” placed on period products, making an already costly experience even more expensive. 

In 2018, my grad school (Edinburgh Napier University) started a scheme with the Scottish Government and Hey Girls to provide students with free period products, and in 2019 the government elected to have that support extended to all period-havers across Scotland. 

But there’s more to eradicating period poverty than handing out a bunch of pads. We also need education and the ability to make informed choices about how to best deal with our periods. One of my favorite aspects of the period product scheme at my school is the ability to make more sustainable choices for my period - both for the environment and for my life. Having the option of not only pads or tampon, but also a menstrual cup and period underwear has changed my life for the better. I love being able to reduce waste and simplify during my period. Now that I’ve tried sustainable period products, I’ll never go back. 

Every body and every situation is different. In order to help those still suffering with period poverty, we need to be able to provide choices that will best align with each persons life. For some, that will be pads, and others, menstrual cups. 

Access to hygiene is a basic human right. Shame has no place here. Every person with a period deserves access to not only the supplies they need, but the ability to make a choice about what they need.","Science, accessibility, sustainability, period, period poverty"
How Trump wants to cast Wuhan Lab and Fauci as villains to energies his supporters,"A little over a year ago, President Donald Trump accused China of wanting him to lose re-election. He had also claimed that he had seen evidence that the coronavirus originated in the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

With American intelligence agencies now strongly suspecting that the virus may have its origins in the Wuhan lab, Trump feels vindicated, and he went hammer and tongs at his critics, saying that he has been proven right. [https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/lab-leak-theory-science-scientists-rcna1191]

At an election rally in Ohio on Saturday, which was held to support a Republican candidate supported by Trump for the House of Representatives, Trump tried to energize the crowd by saying that he was always right about the virus while the media and the Democrats were wrong.

He said, ""I said it comes out of Wuhan - it comes out of the lab."" The crowd went into raptures. Going by the crowd's response to both Fauci and the Wuhan lab, Trump may have kept his fans excited about his possible run for the President's post in 2024.

 According to news reports, Trump has been plotting to cast Anthony Fauci, the man in charge of fighting America's response to Covid and the Wuhan lab as the main culprits for his election difficulties. However, he still maintains that he won the election and that it was stolen from him.

 The Wuhan lab leak theory may have gained some traction recently with President Biden ordering an inquiry into the role of the Wuhan lab, but the Director of National Intelligence, which oversees US spy agencies stated Trump's claims last year saying that it concurred with the ""wide scientific consensus"" regarding Covid-19's natural origins and had said that the virus ""was not manmade or genetically modified"".

But with Trump's ""conspiracy theory"" now proving to be closer to reality than previously thought, he thinks he can boast and be in the spotlight.

"Post Covid, is one dose of vaccine enough for me -an article in nature says yes","Have been asking this question to all my doctor friends- when should I go for the second dose of my Covid vaccine? 
I tested positive for Covid 19 when I was just a week shot of my scheduled second jab. Shall I wait it out for three months or do I go for the vaccines before. While my parents were in the hospital I even got my antibody test done and thankfully my levels are quite high- 335 U/ml. 
Their treating doctor suggested I wait it out. 
Now however an article published in international journal nature says , one dose might just be enough for me . 
The article says many  people who’ve been infected with the coronavirus might be able to safely skip the second jab of any two-dose vaccine regimen- This might be able to help countries were vaccine supplies are scarce. But questions remain about whether the findings hold for all individuals and all vaccines?
The reports quoted Studies and says that people with previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2 tend to mount powerful immune responses to single shots, and gain little added benefit from another injection. What’s more, for people with immunity gained through infection the antibodies are better.
CAN VOUCH for that. My parents had much less antibodies after two shots of Covishield compared to my single shot and post Covid affect. 

France, Germany and Italy, among other countries, now advise only one dose of vaccine for people with a healthy immune system and a confirmed previous diagnosis.

A paper published in Nature on 14 June , team of researchers at the Rockefeller University in New York City and elsewhere studied 26 previously infected people. All of them subsequently received at least one dose of either the Pfizer–BioNTech or the Moderna vaccine, both messenger RNA based vaccines 

The researchers found better ’ levels of ‘neutralizing’ antibodies, potent immune molecules that can block the virus from entering cells and also levels of memory B cells -which remember pathogens and can quickly crank out targeted antibodies incase of infection.

Meghdoot: The Monsoon Magic 14 Your monsoon info at your fingertips,"It has rained very heavily in your city and along with the pleasant feelings, it also brings apprehension about water logging and traffic jams, especially in the metros. So, what do you do to know how much has it rained in your city? Wait for newspaper tomorrow or switch on a TV channel?  

Do you know, you can know it for yourself using the multiple sources of information provided by the India Meteorological Department (IMD)?

To start with, the main website of IMD is a treasure-trove of information. For laypersons and for experts both. If you have never visited it, please do it. Pronto !!! Here it is: https://mausam.imd.gov.in/

You can take a look at the satellite image, including one which shows radar warnings for lightning. Then you can look at current weather image for whole of India. There are district wise and IMD station wise warnings (can be for longer duration including for next five days) and now-casts (for next three hours, especially available for several cities).

This main website also leads you to Regional Meteorological Centres and also to 18-odd Meteorological Centres in various states and then, some city-specific sites too.

For instance, Meteorological Centre, Jaipur can be reached here: https://rmcnewdelhi.imd.gov.in/MET_CENTRES/MCJPR/
Or Meteorological Centre, Agartala can be reached here: https://agartala.imd.gov.in/ .

And then, there are these four apps, which are increasingly gaining popularity in urban areas: Mausam, Meghdoot, Damini and Umang.    
Lastly, this https://city.imd.gov.in/citywx/crowd/enter_th_datag.php for English and
https://city.imd.gov.in/citywx/crowd/enter_th_dataghi.php for Hindi, is where you can give inputs about the meteorological activities in your area and the damage caused due to it. You can also upload photos.

Free Bleeding: Changing Attitudes about Menstruation,"A year ago, I never would’ve made a social media post about it. I wouldn’t have been ashamed or anything—maybe a little embarrassed. I would’ve thought it was too private to talk to anyone but my girl friends about. But in 2019, Scotland became the first country in the world to make period products free.
 
They’re still on shop shelves, of course. You can still pay to have your favorite brand. But they’re available for free in bathrooms and on campuses across the country. This is a major step up from other countries—in the US, for instance, pads and tampons have only recently been considered “daily essentials” instead of “luxuries” in state taxes.
 
Making period products free does more than just save people some money or some stress. First, it’s a step toward ensuring that people from low-income brackets also have what they need. Second, it’s a step in making it less taboo to talk about. Periods happen. Half the population has one (or has had one) every month. So why is it still embarrassing to talk about for so many people?
 
On campus at my school, period products aren’t hidden away in a bathroom or a supply closet.

"covidwarriors Plant a sapling, Abhishek prompts families of Covid victims.","The way humanity acted as a bulwark against the disease is conspicuous.  Everyone who lent their hand to help people in this time of crisis did not think of anything but only to save the lives.
Abhishek Singh is Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) activist from Dhanbad, Jharkhand.
His active work during the time of pandemic has helped many people. He used to get sos requests on his Twitter and Facebook handles.""In a day we helped 100 people.I have a team of  21 people who have been working day and night. The work is divided amongst them. There are people who used to handle different works, some were arranging oxygen while some the  other necessary things.""he said.
The work and response was so active that people did not have to wait for long. From arranging Covid tests for people to providing food, team did a lot.
Abhishek tells that many days were gone without sleep as the surge in the covid cases demanded more attention. 
During the months of April and May when the cases were increasing, and there were scarcity of hospital beds, remdesivir injections or oxygen, even at that time he made it possible to help as much people as he could.
""We connected to people through twitter and facebook, I was able to help many people who used to send requests on my Facebook handle, I remember a request of women who  was in deep agony as there was no one to help her and her husband was ill, I tried to help her from medical tests to even food, it was distressing to see such cases."" Abhishek told.
He says, ""vaccination is important for everyone and I wish everyone to get vaccinated soon "".
Abhishek also told how he along with his team took an initiative on 5th June, World environment day, by deciding  to plant a tree in the name of people who died because of the scarcity of oxygen during Covid, this was a way to connect the families with environment and also create awareness.","covid 19, covid warriors"
How widespread is weight stigma?,"People with higher body weight or larger body size suffer less from obesity and more from prejudices – and the latter are so prevalent everywhere that there’s no cure for them either. They are so widespread, no country or culture seems immune. That is what a new international study has concluded.

People suffering this problem face blame, teasing, bullying, mistreatment, stereotyping and discrimination. They are ridiculed, labelled lazy and lacking in self-discipline. And this goes on everywhere – in schools or workplaces, public places, in cinema and mass media.

Researchers from the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at the University of Connecticut and their colleagues have published the results of a study 
After surveying 13,996 respondents in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the UK, and the US:

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41366-021-00860-z

They conclude: “Weight stigma is prevalent for adults actively engaged in weight management across different Western countries. There were more similarities than differences in the nature, frequency, and interpersonal sources of people’s experiences of weight stigma across the six countries in this study. Findings underscore the need for multinational initiatives to address weight stigma and interventions to support individuals engaged in weight management who experience weight mistreatment.”

Among other pointers from the researchers are:

* Weight stigma is almost universal. [https://globalizationandhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12992-018-0337-x] Prejudices people faced for weight or body size are consistent across the six countries covered in the study.

* Why it persists? People believe, unscientifically, that one is responsible for one’s weight, whereas several factors beyond one’s control result in obesity. 

* If you think that by weight stigma would compel or motivate someone to lose weight, it does not work that way. On the contrary, it has a harmful impact, ranging from emotional distress (low self-esteem, anxiety, etc.) to unhealthy eating behaviors and avoidance of health care.

* But there is hope: public awareness about the harms of “fat shaming” is rising. The ‘Body Positivity’ movement is gaining ground, encouraging people to be at ease with their physical appearance. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/overweight-discrimination-common-harmful/2021/06/11/2946c538-c88c-11eb-afd0-9726f7ec0ba6_story.html]

College can still be rigorous without a lot of homework,"How hard should it be to earn a college degree?

When the book “Academically Adrift” appeared in 2011, it generated widespread concern that college was not effectively educating students and preparing them for today’s world. Among other things, authors Richard Arum and Josipa Roksa claimed that most colleges were not rigorous or demanding, in part because college students were not reading and writing enough in order to build their critical thinking skills. But is it really how much work students are assigned that makes college rigorous and helps them learn?

As a scholar of higher education, I have taken a close look at college students’ academic experiences and outcomes for several years. Some people define rigor as how many pages a student reads or how many pages a student writes. But in a 2021 peer-reviewed study that I published with colleagues John Braxton and Ernie Pascarella, I found that if they do that, they might miss key elements of what it takes to help students develop critical thinking skills and become lifelong learners. They also might create an unnecessary burden for students who have other demands on their time.

What is rigor?

In education, academic rigor tends to be defined in two different ways: as a workload that is demanding and difficult or as learning experiences that challenge and support students to think more deeply.
Given the importance of critical thinking, the way rigor is defined makes a big difference in terms of the ways that the general public – as well as administrators, policymakers, journalists and researchers – assess if a college is rigorous. It also makes a difference in terms of faculties’ expectations for students, the types of classroom activities they use and the assignments they give.

In other words, if rigor means workload, then students who spend a lot of time studying should become better critical thinkers. In contrast, if rigor means academic challenge, then students who practice higher-order thinking skills, such as analysis and evaluation, during class, on assignments and during exams should become better critical thinkers.

10. Dial D for Don: Gifts from the Gulf- The Eventful Breakfast at Hotel Ashok,"“Gifts from the Gulf” continues…

On January 22, 2002 Director, CBI PC Sharma hosted a breakfast at Hotel Ashok for Robert S. Mueller, the then Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), who was visiting Delhi. I too was invited and was seated next to the then Union Home Secretary Kamal Pande. As the meeting proceeded, I overheard an aide whisper into Pande’s ears that the American Centre at Kolkata had been attacked by terrorists. The name Farhan Malik figured in the muted conversation between the Home Secretary and his aide. I thought I must get going right away as, willy-nilly, I was privy to plenty of disparate bits of information that all seemed to add up. Taking leave of the Director after apprising him of the developments, I rushed to my office in the CGO complex on Lodhi Road. 

I was soon on line with Rajeev Kumar, Special Superintendent of Police (CID) of West Bengal, based in Kolkata. Rajeev had remained in touch with me for some time prior to this incident in connection with the sensational kidnapping of Partha Pratim Roy Burman, Chairman-cum- Managing Director of Khadim Shoes in July 2001. Rajeev had done extensive legwork on the kidnapping case and interrogated Asif Raza Khan in Rajkot. He had heard hours of recorded conversation between Aftab, negotiating the ransom amount from Dubai, and the Burman family. He had obtained a scanned copy of Aftab’s Pakistani passport and had all its details, which he had shared with Interpol, Delhi and me. He had informed me that Aftab had a passport issued from the Regional Passport Office in Patna. I had deputed an officer to proceed to Patna and seize Aftab’s original passport file in CBI’s Santalpur Arms Case.

History is turning a lot more kinder to PVNR - on his 100 birth anniversary,"At the fag end of his second tenure, after being accused as a weak Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh had famously said in 2014 that history will be more kind to him than opposition and contemporary media. Seven years after we know for sure that that wheels of history are have started to turn in case Singh but in case of a man who brought him to politics, PV Narasimha Rao, history has already turned lot more kinder than then the time he walked and talked on the earth. 

1991. PVNR sits on the hot seat. Just have a look at the situation in the country.

1. Trumatic assassination of the one of the tallest leaders of the country that left Congress  like a leaderless crowd

2. Burning Punjab

3. Burning Kashmir

4. Economy in deep trouble

5. Minority government

6. Over a year after taking over as PM, demolition of Babri Masjid left his government crippled and mind you, it was already on clutches. Following that country got engulfed in riots and Mumbai was attacked.

7. Disintegration of USSR left India ally-less in UN and elsewhere and even an assistant secretary of state from the US could bark at us on Kashmir

But PVNR deftly handled all this one by one, some with fair hand and some with the crookedness of a seasoned politician. 

He brought in Manmohan Singh to deal with economy.

Gave KPS Gill and Beant Singh a free hand to deal with Punjab terrorism.

By the end of his term, elections were held in J&K.

He sent his political rival Atal Bihari Vajpayee to Geneva to defend the country

And yes, he made underhand deals to save his government. 

Also he chargesheeted politicians in the Hawala case to show he was anti-corruption crusader but he was an opportunist of highest order as weak charges led to acquittal of all.

He used levers of power to keep the Gandhi family and it's Darbaris in check. 

And there were Chandraswamis and Harshad Mehtas but he managed to stay in seat.

And finally he managed to complete his term. First prime minister outside the Nehru-Gandhi family to do so......",pvnr

What really happened on Mt Everest: Was there Covid-19 or not?,"After a year of closure, Nepal opened Mount Everest for climbers this year – with precautions. Soon there were reports of coronavirus infections at the base camp. By the end of the climbing season this month, several climbers have spoken of infections on social media, but the government flatly refuses to acknowledge.

Up to 59 infected people had been on the Everest, and five reached the top too, the New York Times estimates on the basis of interviews with climbers and expedition companies and social media posts. [https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/27/world/asia/covid-mount-everest-nepal.html] Nepal maintains all protocols were properly followed and there was no incidence of Covid-19 at the world’s tallest mountain. 

For instance, in April, a Norwegian climber was down with cough and fever, symptoms of Covid-19, but a tourism official cited hospital authorities claiming it was possibly a case of pneumonia. (His final diagnosis is not known.) [https://kathmandupost.com/national/2021/04/21/nepal-sets-climber-quotas-to-prevent-crowds-on-everest] Nepal officials dismiss social media accounts and add that coughing and breathlessness of course is expected in high altitudes and dry mountain air. 

That sounds perfectly logical too, but in the absence of a Covid-19 negative test, the doubt will remain. There were, after all, an exceptionable number of airlifting and cancellations of expeditions (which is rare, after all the preparations). 

Nepal’s economy depends heavily on tourism and climbers (it is home to several of the world’s tallest peaks), and 2020 was mostly a lost year. As sustaining tourism would be a top priority, official denials would remain suspect in the absence of evidence. 

The Sherpa community, whose members make a living by helping climbers, is not happy. A spokesperson has demanded investigation, as many Sherpa apparently fell prey to the virus. One of them, Jangbu Sherpa, may as well be the first person to scale the tallest peak with Covid-19! (It was the 17th time he was there.) On the way to the peak, he had to be airlifted; he was hospitalized in Kathmandu, tested positive, but a fortnight later he returned to the base camp and accompanied a Bahraini prince to the top on May 11.

Reminiscing good old days,"College life is that part of your life that you are going to relive in your memories till you breathe. My college life started in 2019, luckily  because unlike many freshers; we got to attend one year of college. Like everyone else I was also too excited for going to college, while most of it was about the freedom I was going to get away from home, from restrictions, away from constant scolding but completely oblivious to the fact that it will also be away from family, from home cooked delicious meals, from all the pampering when you get home after a hectic day. For me first two months were not as good as being an introvert I didn’t speak to many students in my college OR PG. I was way too home sick while most of the girls in my PG used to have fun together discussing weird fetishes. I used to sit in my room holding my pillow weeping and wailing.  But then slowly and gradually as you start talking to people, go for hang outs, and know them more, this becomes your second home. Late night talks, combo of Maggi and tea even at 3 in the morning.  Constant fights who drank my milk, my cloth is missing blah blah was our daily routine giving us good belly laugh. While college life is not always about happy moments it’s about the beautiful memories we capture out of the most uncertain times. From attending every single class to striving to get 67% attendance, from getting ready in one hour to going in the same night suit hoodie, from eating pg ka khana  to aaj arts faculty se hi kha lenge , from completing your homework daily to studying one week prior to the exam. From waking up at sharp 8 to waking up at 2 in the afternoon, from getting pg by 6 to having night out with friends , from less of the captures to more of the fun. We have made infinite memories within finite number of days. I would like to end it here just by saying “WO DIN BHI KYA DIN THE “.","fun, friends, family, college life, pixstory pro, good old days"
Is President Biden alright?,"It flew under the radar but nevertheless it could have been devastating news. Shortly after President Biden stood outside the White House with a group of bipartisan Senators, he seemed to walk back on his support for the infrastructure compromise.

In a press conference, Biden announced that his support for the infrastructure compromise was dependent on support for his jobs plan. Republicans were shocked by this as in their conversations they heard nothing of the sort. It started a 48 hour scramble to figure out what was actually going on.

Eventually, Biden walked back on his walk back, and came out in support of the compromise. However, it begs the question of where our President’s mind is at? One second supporting and the next second not, and then the reversing it again is not a good look from the White House.","biden, bill, compromise"
Did Indian Coast Guard intercept boats with narcotics and weapons headed to Kerala?,"By Archit Mehta

A video has been shared on social media with the claim that drugs worth Rs 3,000 and arms and ammunition were seized in Minicoy Islands in Lakshadweep when they were being illegally shipped to Kerala.

Alt News has received verification requests for the claim on its WhatsApp helpline number (+91 76000 11160).

The claim was also widespread earlier in March ahead of assembly elections in Kerala. On March 18, the Indian Coast Guard intercepted three Sri Lankan fishing boats near Lakshadweep islands and seized a huge cache of drugs and weapons. A week later several social media users claimed that the boats were trying to smuggle illegal goods into Kerala and shared an image of stacks of drugs.

Several Facebook users made this claim as well. Alt News had also received multiple requests to verify this on WhatsApp.

The image shared along with the viral claim was published in a 2020 Al Jazeera report. As per the story, the image shows several 1 kg packages of drugs busted by Marshall Islands police. The Marshall Islands are a chain of volcanic islands and coral atolls in the central Pacific Ocean, between Hawaii and the Philippines.

The total stockpile weighed 649 kg and its worth was estimated to be about $80m. As per Al Jazeera, this was the nation’s largest-ever haul of cocaine. The drugs washed up on Ailuk atoll after drifting on the high seas in an abandoned boat.

The video currently viral indeed pertains to the drug bust in Minicoy Islands. The video was uploaded by Kanak News in March however, the channel hasn’t claimed that the boats were ‘headed’ to Kerala.

Alt News also found articles on the internet which stated the same.

Users of the Alt News app requested us to verify this claim.

FALSE CLAIM 
There are two aspects to this claim – the narrative itself and the photograph accompanying it.

BHAGAVAD GITA NOT COMPULSORY IN THE NETHERLANDS

It is utterly false that the Netherlands has made the Bhagavad Gita compulsory in schools. The list of mandatory subjects for primary education in the Netherlands is readily available on the website of the Government of Netherlands. Compulsory subjects include Dutch, English, arithmetic and mathematics, social and environmental studies, creative expression, and sport and movement. There is no reference to the Bhagavad Gita as a compulsory subject/module for primary education in the Netherlands.

PHOTO FROM 2013
Alt News reverse-searched the photograph of the two young girls which has been circulated along with the claim, and found that it had been uploaded in September 2013 on a website, Iskcon Mind Tree. It may be noted that ISKCON is a cult of Krishna followers.

It may be stated that the social media claim about the Netherlands making the Bhagavad Gita compulsory in schools is a hoax, and has been posted on websites and circulated on various social media platforms since at least 2016.",alt news

"BJP’s Priti Gandhi shares photo from Philippines as Mithi River, Mumbai","By Kalim Ahmed

BJP Mahila Morcha social media in-charge Priti Gandhi juxtaposed an image of the Sabarmati Riverfront in Ahmedabad with an image, she claimed, of the Mithi River in Mumbai. Gandhi attempted to portray that Mithi River is in poor condition despite the Maharashtra government spending over Rs 1,000 crores on its development.

( Link https://twitter.com/MrsGandhi/status/1409073334751404032?s=19)

The claim is viral on both Twitter and Facebook. Screenshots of her tweet are also being shared on Facebook.

Fact-check
The first image shared by Gandhi indeed shows the Sabarmati Riverfront in Ahmedabad and can be found on the attraction’s official website. For the second image, a simple reverse image search on Google took us to this article that attributes the photo to Getty Images. We found the same image on iStock by Getty Images. As per the description, the photo was taken in January 2008 in Manila, Philippines.

An article published by The Indian Express in 2019, says that the Mithi River Development and Protection Authority (MRDPA) was formed in 2006 to coordinate between the MMRDA and BMC for the restoration of Mithi and to mitigate flooding. However, the committee has not met even once since 2013. An RTI report revealed that both MMRDA and BMC had spent over Rs 1,200 crore on various projects for Mithi river restoration and cleaning.

According to Frontline, BMC has set aside Rs.1,400 crore this year for the rejuvenation and beautification of Dahisar, Poisar, and Oshiwara (or Walbhat) rivers. “The Mithi river will receive special treatment because it has received a high level of abuse. It has a separate budget of Rs. 569.52 crore,” says the report.

There are several photos of the Mithi River in an abysmal condition.

Major Surendra Poonia recently shared a 30-second video and wrote, “Why doesn’t Arvind Kejriwal listen to Manish Sisodia? AdManKejriwal.”

In this clip, Sisodia can be heard saying, “They run full-page ads in newspapers all over the country. Every day there are a handful of ads in numerous newspapers. Had they spent this money on procuring vaccines, it would have been enough to cover the whole country. I want to emphasize that the public needs vaccines, not advertisements. And on top of that, they are pressurising officers to continue pushing out advertisements. They aren’t providing vaccines, just printing ads endlessly.” The video shows a newspaper ad featuring Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal as Sisodia speaks.

Facebook page Political Kida, which has been caught sharing false news on multiple occasions, shared the video and accused Kejriwal of “no vaccination, only ads”.

( Link https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=940364993476713&id=414102052750947)

The video is massively widespread on pro-Modi pages on Facebook.

Fact-check

It is evident the video has been edited due to the number of jump cuts that appear. Alt News discovered that the original video pertains to a June 21 press conference addressed by Manish Sisodia where he was criticising the centre’s vaccination efforts. He also tweeted a video of the occasion.

( Link https://twitter.com/msisodia/status/1406892581217132545?s=19)

The portions featured in the viral clip appear after the 5-minute mark. We have highlighted the various parts of the address that have been stitched together to manufacture the edited video.

“Ads by BJP-ruled states are featured in newspapers all across the country. Along with this, the centre has run its own ads separately. However, they all say the same thing, ‘The world’s biggest free vaccination campaign’. The same advertisement has been reprinted by the Uttar Pradesh government across India. And the Uttarakhand government followed suit. Now, the Karnataka government is running such ads in New Delhi. So there aren’t vaccines available across the country, but vaccine-related ads. All the BJP state governments run full-page ads in newspapers all over the country.

Britney Spears: Why has no male celeb ever faced anything like her travails?,"Pop star Britney Spears has any many fans as detractors. Reactions to her latest courtroom testimony are mixed too. But one thing even her critics too would agree with is that her travails are something no male celebrity would ever face.

Full testimony:
https://variety.com/2021/music/news/britney-spears-full-statement-conservatorship-1235003940/

Spears has been under ‘conservatorship’ since 2008, after her mental health prompted her father, Jamie Spears, to petition the court for legal authority over his daughter’s life. Under this unusual arrangement, her life is managed by her father. She often can’t carry her own credit card, phone or passport without permission. It goes well beyond finances – not only to the extent of deciding the most trivial things but also the most important ones, including her wish to marry her boyfriend and have another baby – she has two but now the conservatorship would not agree to let her remove her IUD. 

In reaction to her outburst in court, Jamie Spears has said he always had her best interests at heart. Spears has been trying to end the conservatorship arrangement for 13 years; she is yet to succeed. [https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/22/arts/music/britney-spears-conservatorship.html] 

For a 39-year-old professional, this level of paternalism is a gross violation of human rights. If it is justified on the grounds of her mental health in the past, a Washington Post columnist quips that there are any number of male stars who have displayed mental instability and drug abuses. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/06/26/britney-spears-conservatorship-mistreatment/]
 “Within seconds, I can name Michael Jackson, Kanye West and Robert Downey Jr., who once got taken away by the police after he walked into a neighbor’s home, undressed and fell asleep in a child’s bed.” [https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/aug/24/robertdowneyjr.usa]

Is it the case that men are assumed to be competent, capable and in control? That they can retain their sense of agency intact no matter what mental-health issues they could be facing – whereas a woman needs a guardian in such instances? Spears’s mental health, her past statement, legal issues around conservatorship – they are all worth debating, but there is underlying gender discrimination which too should be added to the debates.

And of course,  the subject would not be taboo. There would be monthly discussions on every national network about it. People would be well acquainted with all the facts about periods from the time they are toddlers. Nobody would dare to suggest that men are unclean during their period, or that they ought to be banished to a Period Hut.

Conversion therapy is discredited and increases risk of suicide,"Pride Month is being marked by some lawmakers in Kentucky with a renewed push to ban “conversion therapy – the discredited practice of trying to change someone’s sexual orientation or gender identity.

If successful, the bill, which aims to prohibit mental health professionals in the state from ""engaging in sexual orientation and gender identity change efforts” with minors, would make Kentucky the 21st state in the U.S. to put in place such a prohibition.

Other states are likewise cracking down on the delegitimized practice. Michigan’s governor signed an executive directive on June 14, 2021, blocking the use of state funds for conversion therapy with minors.

As experts in mental health counseling, we welcome these moves. But we remain concerned that at present many LGBTQ youth live in states that have no ban in place protecting them from conversion therapy – a practice that the scientific community has long since shunned.

What is conversion therapy?

Conversion therapy, or the practice of attempting to change a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity, has also been known as reparative therapy or “the gay cure.” It began being practiced in the late 1900s and is based on an outdated and incorrect notion that such identities are a choice that can be changed.

Early conversion therapy included lobotomies – surgical procedures on the brain – and aversion therapies, such as giving people electric shocks while they looked at homoerotic material. It now involves more behavioral techniques, such as forcing people to be celibate or making them dress in accordance with their assigned gender roles. It is often accompanied with requiring the person to pray and having others pray for them to make this change.

Multiple professional bodies including the American Medical Association, the American Psychological Association and the American Counseling Association have over the past 20 years denounced conversion therapy and determined it to be deliberately harmful and abusive to clients who are subjected to the practice. A 2020 study from the UCLA School of Law’s Williams Institute found that gay, lesbian and bisexual people who experienced conversion therapy were almost twice as likely to have suicidal thoughts and to have attempted suicide.

I love the way the sky looks on a bright and sunny day,
and even when it’s rainy, I love the shades of gray.
I love the smell of the ocean, the sound of waves upon the sand,
I love the feel of seashells and how they look in my hand.

Missing out the morning attendance,"It's been almost a year that I visited my campus. It is really a big time loss. That rat race of being on time and chasing for 66.67% of attendance was hard to do but the relief we use to get after completing for one subject is irreplaceable. I really being on time. I hardly ever missed that one class attendance. We all are missing those runway path to rush to college, having a breakfast as decent people never happened because ""Dude, you are in college, aaram se khayegi kya?"" Basically being sophisticated was cursed. So we had to be little 'badtameez' or jungli to just finish that one plate. Or just keep your hand dirty and rush to the class. Where the professor will be present before 9 A.M. to take the attendance exactly by 9.05. ""Common dude, we were in traffic"" or ""metro band tha sir"". These were the lines students made to get that one precious attendance.  Whereas the professors used to be like ""Come on time, wake up early and rush to metro early"". Because they didn't want there teaching to get hampered with students coming late to the class. 

I personally felt bad for those who missed their attendance with just a moment of second and the teacher couldn't even agree to give them one by any chance. Keeping the tears in their eyes, the students bear the pain of insult. While some students were like I don't even care just getting 66.67% is enough for me, I will attend 3 classes a week and done. These guys must be happy now too. And why not they don't even need to go to the college. And it's also sure that they won't be attending classes in online mode too. 'Kya hi pharak padta hai'. Chill bro!!

Seriously, the class mixture of backbenchers, frontbenchers, idiots and toppers was delicious in itself.  The class only looks like class when we have all the elements in them. That morning rush is still the best. Irreplaceable. ","morning, college life, attendance"

2. khaki files - Devil's Advocate: Inside Tihar Jail - Was I walking into hell on earth?,"Devil’s Advocate continues ………….

Readers may further like to know a bit about the hierarchical structure of the jail staff. Under the director general, who heads the prisons department, a deputy inspector general of prisons serves as the second in command. Under them, a superintendent heads the administration of a jail. A deputy superintendent, assistant superintendents and head wardens followed by jail wardens assist the jail superintendent.

A couple of days after taking over, I decided to pay a visit to all the jails in the Tihar complex. The visit began from jail number two, where convicts sentenced to imprisonment for ten years or more were lodged. I must confess that before I stepped in, I was full of trepidation. Was I walking into hell on earth? How would the inmates react on seeing me? Would I be booed or jeered at by them? All manner of fears haunted me.

Escorted by jail staff, I entered jail number two and the sight I beheld was in sharp contrast to what I was expecting. The sprawling campus was a vast space of lush green lawns with squeaky-clean pathways flanked by tall trees. To my right, soon after the entry point, was a flour mill where wheat was being crushed to make flour. 

The staff led me in and  I stood there for a few minutes to observe the proceedings. Convicts, all dressed in their immaculate white uniforms, were running the unit in unison. They greeted me respectfully and then went about doing their jobs as the crushing machine was operational and could not be left unattended. Each inmate was engrossed in his work, and if at all they spoke to one another, it was in low, hushed whispers.

As I stepped out, the only sound one could clearly hear in the campus was the song of birds chirping in the background. I walked on and was ushered into the garment-making section of the prison. Mannequins stood outside the section dressed in outfits designed and stitched by inmates who worked with devotion on their machines or handlooms.

The curious case of Congress' change of heart towards Narasimha Rao,"Till last year, it was almost forbidden to take the name of former Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao in the Congress.

The reason being the uneasy relationship Congress President Sonia Gandhi shared with Rao. Sonia Gandhi, according to several Congress leaders, held Rao responsible for the inordinate delay in the probe into the assassination of her husband and former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. In fact, she had once remarked that if the investigation related to the killing of a former Prime Minister was to take so much time what would be the fate of ordinary citizens who fight for justice. 

The mistrust further deepened after Rao was blamed for his political misjudgment of the Ayodhya issue and his failure to stop the demolition of Babri Masjid on December 6, 1992.

The relations soured to the extent that his body was not even allowed inside the party's headquarters at 24, Akbar Road in Delhi in December 2004, and the cortege was parked on the pavement outside the main gate. The Nehru-Gandhi family and the Congress rarely mentioned his name in any of its programmes or party gatherings. 

Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who was the finance minister in the Rao government that is credited with initiating the path-breaking economic reforms, was the only Congress leader to regularly pay tribute to Rao. 

Others in the Congress had usually been more reticent about this. But that changed last year when several Congress leaders, including Rahul Gandhi and P Chidambaram, paid tribute to Rao on his birth anniversary. Chidambaram mooted the idea of naming a university, existing or new, after him. 

Perhaps competitive politics to claim his legacy forced the change in the Congress stand as TRS government in Telangana kicked off year-long centenary celebrations of Rao with a publicity blitz. 

TRS supremo and Telangana chief minister K Chandrashekhar Rao, even made a strong pitch for conferring Bharat Ratna, the highest civilian award, on Rao and placed him at par with the country’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was also lavish in his praise for Rao. 

And on his birth centenary today, the Congress paid glowing tributes to the late leader, highlighting his role in transforming Indian economy.","Politics, congress, sonia gandhi, narasimha rao"

"1.	Devil's Advocate: From catching criminals to looking after their reformation as DG, Prisons","I was posted as the director general of prisons, Delhi, on 22 November 2010. 

Having served all my years with the police force in mainstream police assignments, this posting came as a shock, at least initially. A bit of unsavoury police politics was behind it, but I will not waste my breath over it here. As it turned out, my stint in the new job turned out to be a memorable and fulfilling tenure. This story is one of many from my Tihar days.

Delhi prisons are commonly referred to as Tihar Jail. However, what is not commonly known is that it is not one jail, but consists of ten jails—numbered one to ten— located in one complex in what was once an urban village called Tihar. Another prison complex exists in Rohini, in far west Delhi, which is also an integral part of the prisons department of the capital. In 2016, five years after I left the prisons department, another prison complex, comprising six jails, became operational at Mandoli in north-east Delhi, bordering Uttar Pradesh.

It may be of some interest for a reader that besides the director general, who is a senior officer from the Indian Police Service (IPS), no other staff member serving in the jail is from the police. Therefore, when an IPS officer joins at the senior-most position in the prisons department, he is the sole policeman there and finds himself ‘alone’ in an unfamiliar environment. The discipline, regimentation and camaraderie found in the police are missing. 

More importantly, having spent his entire professional life pursuing and putting away offenders, he is suddenly supervising their correctional and reformation work—an occupation he is clueless about. The assignment thus is not particularly coveted and often considered a ‘punishment’ posting. This is true not only of Delhi but most other states in India as well.

How it feels to miss on College Life?,"According to you, what is the most fun part of your life as a student?
No doubt, most of you would say 'College'

I am jealous of you all who have been to college and enjoyed your college life because I am unable to do that. I just have to wake up early in the morning to attend my lectures virtually sitting in front of a laptop where I am not getting anything. I am unable to meet anyone in person and I cannot interact with people in person or know about them.
I am a 1st year student from Shaheed Sukhdev College of Business Studies and I have visited my college only once and it has really amazing infrastructure and I just want to visit it every day, enjoy each and every moment of my college life with my friends but I can't.
The above pic is of my College Library and when I visited it I just wanted to sat down there and forget everything. It was a very large and peaceful space and it was so well maintained by the authorities.
So far, my college life is just revolving around some apps like Whatsapp, Google meet and Google Classroom.
To understand things in a virtual classroom is really a difficult task for a student because there are many distractions. When you are studying virtually the main thing is to have a good internet connection which not everyone can have. Many people may have affordability issues. Also there are students who just join to disturb the whole class by turning on their mics and making weird noises.
So it is all really annoying for those who really want to study and they are not able to focus whereas when you are attending college physically these things can be ruled out and obviously without any doubt if you want to experience a good college life, you would want offline college rather than online.
I know many of you who are not able to go to college can relate to this post and also who have enjoyed their college lives can feel our pain :)","college life, college"
��Curiosity- what can we do?,"I recently read somewhere that an average kid asks about 40000 questions between the age of 2 and 5!!! That's approximately 400 questions a day on average..

And yet as we grow older, we lose this ability to ask questions. Just as a simple thought exercise - think about how many questions come to our mind in a given time frame.

While part of it is a logical - as we grow we start understanding how things work, so obviously some questions are already answered. The worry however is new questions stop coming to our mind.

A large part of this is to do with what skills get rewarded in life. Asking questions is rarely rewarded. In fact, the average person asking too many questions is met with some degree of ridicule.

Some of it is the education system - which relies more on learning and memorizing.

Part of the responsibility lies with parents and teachers - who do not encourage questioning by kids.

End result - we lose our curiosity!

However, we live in a world where constant learning is absolutely critical. Almost all of our learning is dependent on what questions we ask. If we don't ask the right questions, or any questions, we don't learn anything new. This is even more important in areas such as research / financial analysis / investing

The solution - build education systems that reward curiosity. Constantly remind oneself that asking questions is good. And if a child asks you a question, however silly or repetitive it appears, never discourage them from doing so. Encourage them to ask more!

The surface of Venus is cracked and moves like ice floating on the ocean,"The big idea

Much of the brittle, upper crust of Venus is broken into fragments that jostle and move – and the slow churning of Venus’ mantle beneath the surface might be responsible. My colleagues and I arrived at this finding using decades-old radar data to explore how the surface of Venus interacts with the interior of the planet. We describe it in a new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on June 21, 2021.

Planetary scientists like me have long known that Venus has a plethora of tectonic landforms. Some of these formations are long, thin belts where the crust has been pushed together to form ridges or pulled apart to form troughs and grooves. In many of these belts there’s evidence that pieces of the crust have moved side to side, too.

Our new study shows, for the first time, that these bands of ridges and troughs often mark the boundaries of flat, low-lying areas that themselves show relatively little deformation and are individual blocks of Venus’ crust that have shifted, rotated and slid past each other over time – and may have done so in the recent past. It’s a little like Earth’s plate tectonics but on a smaller scale and more closely resembles pack ice that floats atop the ocean.

Researchers have hypothesized that – just like Earth’s mantle – the mantle of Venus swirls with currents as it’s heated from below. My colleagues and I modeled the sluggish but powerful movement of Venus’ mantle and showed that it is sufficiently forceful to fragment the upper crust everywhere we’ve found these lowland blocks.

Why it matters

A major question about Venus is whether the planet has active volcanoes and tectonic faulting today. It’s essentially the same size, composition and age as Earth – so why wouldn’t it be geologically alive?

But no mission to Venus has yet conclusively shown the planet to be active. There’s tantalizing but ultimately inconclusive evidence that volcanic eruptions have taken place there in the geologically recent past – and are perhaps even ongoing.

Roopa Pai's Gita for Children - Would strongly recommend for adults too,"Staying with the theme of the excellent work being produced by women authors. 

Just finished reading Roopa Pai's Gita for Children. An amazing piece of work - not only is it made intelligible and interesting for children (teenage the right age, I think), but it captures the essence of Gita's philosophy/teachings. 

In fact, recommended strongly for all adults who haven't read any commentary on the Bhagvatgita, or haven't understood the dense work/s they have attempted to read. 

Roopa Pai is obviously remarkably talented - sincere compliments to her for producing such a gem.","rajiv mehrishi, roopa pai, gita for children"

The reigning champions Portugal were the better team for most of the game, especially in the second half, but Belgium were resilient in defence and Thibaut Courtois only had a few relatively straightforward saves to make. Raphael Guerreiro hit the post late on and Diogo Jota missed two presentable chances.

In the end the game was settled by Thorgan Hazard’s fierce drive just before half time. It may interrupt Rui Patricio’s sleep for the forseeable, because he probably should have done better.

"Policeman wife and daughter killed, JK witnessing increased violence after Delhi Meeting","A Special Police Officer (SPO) and his wife and young daughter were killed after militants opened  fire at them in their house at Hariparigam village in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama district.

The incident took place on Sunday night. While the couple was killed during the attack, their daughter who had sustained critical injuries in the attack died in the morning. The security forces have cordoned off and launched a search operation.
The attack comes hours after  explosive-laden drones were used to attack an air force base in Jammu city- in what is being called called first such incident of its kind in the country.
The attacks have seen an increase since Kashmiri leaders met Prime Minister Modi on June 24, in centers outreach post abrogation Of article 370. 
While the meeting had no agenda , the leaders from the erstwhile state are collectively believed to have pressed for restoration of statehood. 
J&K’s local pro-India parties, have been opposing New Delhi’s unilateral decisions on and after August 5, 2019. There is also a great sense of public alienation with New Delhi post the move. 

The meeting which is seen as a sudden shift from the centers earlier policy of non engaging with the local leadership. The move Kashmir watchers say is regional and global developments like Regular clashes with China on the borders, the possible political change in Afghanistan and US Biden administrations interests in the area. 
Reports also suggest UAE has been facilitating back channel dialogue between India and Pakistan.  Infiltration attempts have reduced on the borders. However the new attacks might again put strain on the relationship between the two countries.  NIA is investigating whether the drones used in the attack were controlled from within the country or the control was from across the border.

"HOW A RESET CAN HELP YOU GET BACK 
ON TRACK","Whenever I can’t seem to stick to a task or lack inspiration to do anything I simply hit the reset button.

If everything seems to frustrate you or you feel down. If you begin lagging behind and are falling back on deadlines. If you simply can’t get anything done it's time for a mental reset.

How do I normally go about this ?
The first thing I do is to declutter everything. My desk,my room and my digital workspace. Making space and room for ideas and inspiration is necessary.

Then I go back to the drawing board to change anything and everything that hasn’t been working so far.
Remove things that are hampering your workflow and are draining you. Start replacing it with things that normally energize you.

And lastly remember that a new day is a new start. Always press the reset button and start things differently. Every morning- start with a fresh perspective on things. Look at your work and creativity through a new window.

"On way to join as SP, Mehbubnagar, DGP sent wireless message that posting was cancelled","Down The Memory Lane........

I was finally transferred from Vijayawada in September 1984, after serving there for little less than three years, as Additional Superintendent of Police Ananatapur District. 

The short posting, which lasted for about two months was almost eventless except that I had to manage a visit of the then Vice President Dr. Shankar Dayal Sharma to Puttaparti town. Apart from that, we hunted unsuccessfully for a Hyena in the jungles along with forest officials, which suspected to have injured a child. 

 

After a short posting at Anantapur District, I was posted as Superintendent of Police Mahbubnagar District in Telangana region of united Andhra Pradesh. 

I left Anantapur town to join my new place of posting in my personal vehicle. Driving on Bangalore –Hyderabad Highway, I was stopped at Kurnool District headquarters by a traffic constable who handed me an urgent wireless message from DGP office (also called chief office in Andhra Pradesh) that my posting stood cancelled and I was required to report at Chief Office for further orders.

 

I checked up with some seniors at Hyderabad as to why it has happened, I was informed that the incumbent SP has rallied some political support and was instrumental in organising demonstrations in the district against his transfer.  

Anyway, it did not matter much to me except that it made me worried as what I have to do at Hyderabad as I would have no posting. I drove straight to Hyderabad without touching Mahbubnagar town, which was situated on a small detour from Highway.

Congress shall be fulcrum of any alliance against BJP: Tejashwi Yadav,"The Congress being a national party with a pan-India presence should be the fulcrum in any national coalition against the ruling BJP, said the opposition leader Tejashwi Yadav on Sunday.

Tejashwi, who steered the grand alliance coalition with the Congress and left parties in 2020 assembly polls in Bihar, said that the Congress is in a direct fight with the BJP on more than 200 Lok Sabha seats and the party should focus on it. It should let the regional parties be in the driver seat in their respective constituencies.

The RJD leader’s statement assumes significance in the backdrop of the recent Rashtra Manch meeting among prominent Opposition leaders and civil society members at Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar’s residence in Delhi. Congress leaders did not attend the meeting.

The June 22 meeting sparked off rumours of a “third front”, besides the Congress and BJP. However, on June 25, Pawar said any alternative front, if it is formed, cannot leave the Congress. On June 26, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut, too, dismissed the prospect of an Opposition alliance without the Congress.

Bihar Congress may get fresh committees ahead of new president,"Subhash Pathak 
Patna: The All India Congress Committee (AICC) may announce the formation of a few committees, before appointing a new president for Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC), said party officials in the know.

Party insiders said that the AICC has decided to take some more time and consult senior state leaders before deciding the BPCC chief.

AICC in-charge for Bihar Bhakta Charan Das said that he would meet the party high command soon with reports suggesting a change in committees on the basis of feedbacks from the party workers. “So far as the decision on change of leadership in the state is concerned, final decision would be taken after fresh round of consultation with senior leaders,” said Das.

Leaders privy to the developments in the AICC said that a few important committees like the working committee, advisory committee and coordination panel could be announced for the BPCC in the next few weeks after Das’s meeting with the AICC president Sonia Gandhi or vice-president Rahul Gandhi. “It would be a mix of young faces and veterans to revive the organisation down to the grassroots level,” said a senior leader.

An AICC general secretary, pleading anonymity, said that the process to notify the new president and committee might take a few weeks. “The AICC in-charge is yet to submit his report to the president about his meeting with party workers and the kisan satyagrah across the state, which were held in February- March,” he said.

The talk for change of guard in the state picked momentum following the AICC’s move to reshuffle the state units in Punjab, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Goa and Uttarakhand likely next month. 

A section of leaders led by Jamtara legislator Irfan Ansari also met AICC seniors with the demand to reconstitute the organisation. Encouraged by the hint of reshuffle, some senior leaders from Bihar have also been camping in New Delhi to bolster their chance of being catapulted to the top position.

 I don’t ever recall these beliefs being directly instilled in me. Why did it seem like I automatically believed the lighter the better? I was in elementary school when a friend and I noticed how our skin color fluctuates from season to season. My skin was tanned from the excessive amount of time I spent outside under the summer sun. We compared our tans. She raised her radiant toffee arm up to my dull mahogany colored arm. I shoved my arm away. I was pained. The pain cut like razors across my veins. Why did I feel so inferior? I longed to feel comfortable in my own skin.

IYC Volunteers worked tirelessly and provided all necessary help to the needy:Rahul Rao,"Rahul Rao, the National Media in-charge of the Indian Youth Congress, has been among those at the forefront of providing help to the needy since the Covid-19 struck the country in March last year. 
During the first wave, he said the focus was on migrant workers who were desperately trying to reach their homes in different parts of the country. 
""From providing food to migrant workers to distributing masks and sanitisers to countless people, the IYC members worked tirelessly during the first wave,"" said Rao. 
 He said blood donation camps were organised in every state and IYC volunteers promptly came forward. 
The IYC members were asked to report to their respective headquarters across the country and ensure the migrant workers were provided with the required help. 
But the situation drastically changed in the second wave that ravaged the country from second week of April onwards. 
""In the second wave, situation was more strenuous and our volunteers used to go to the houses of infected people to give and set up oxygen cylinders apart from providing beds. Our National President  Srinivas BV was promptly responding to all the distress calls,"" said Rao. 
He said there were even requests from the borders and in one case medicines were delivered at Nepal border. 
The pandemic came with some unprecedented challenges. 
Rao narrated how IYC volunteers had to stand in queues for 24 hours and get the oxygen cylinders refilled. No one feared of losing their lives and worked in every situation. 
Recalling an incident, he said there was a family of three members and all of them were infected. ""There was no one to take care and I got a call seeking help for them. I visited them and gave whatever was required. They were in panic as their oxygen level had majorly gone down. I made sure they got everything. The fact that I was able to help and see them recover made me happy.""Rao further said they also fed stray dogs and birds. 
""As people stayed indoors due to the lockdown, our volunteers roamed around different places to feed the hungry animals. That surely was a noble cause.""","covid 19, covid warriors"

US third parties can rein in the extremism of the two-party system,"When the Republican Party ousted Liz Cheney from a leadership position, it exposed a major ideological divide within the current GOP. That caused some people, including prominent Republicans, to suggest there might be a third party in the making.

Most commentators and political scientists have dismissed that idea, observing the inevitability of U.S. politics remaining a two-party system.

But my research finds circumstances are better now for a third-party insurgency than at any time over the past century. Though there is no way to predict precisely when a third party will emerge, the situation is in fact ripe for a third party to challenge what has become a Donald Trump-controlled Republican Party.

My research also finds that the most successful third parties in U.S. politics don’t typically rise to dominance but instead challenge the major parties enough to force them to change course.

A brief history of US third parties

In my 2018 book, “The Demise and Rebirth of American Third Parties,” I explain that the strength of third parties since the American Civil War has been closely related to how polarized the two major parties have been. When the major parties are highly polarized, larger groups of voters end up being not represented by either one, and the intense contention between them also increases political dissatisfaction.

The Democratic and Republican parties were extremely polarized for a half-century after the Civil War. During this period, third parties were aggressive and strong.

Their goal, however, was not to attempt multiparty democracy, as some hope for today.

Supporting poor farmers and opposing business monopolies, the Greenback Party shook up electoral politics in the 1870s and 1880s, winning widespread support, especially across the Midwest. The Populist Party, which was also a party supporting poor farmers, was even more successful in the 1890s. It collapsed by 1900, but during its brief existence it threatened the Democratic Party to the degree that the Democrats eventually adopted many Populist stands and made leading Populist William Jennings Bryan their presidential candidate.

Do house plants really purify air?,"For decades, people have believed house plants to be natural air purifiers.

Conclusion to one famous NASA experiment, published in 1989, was that indoor plants can scrub the air of cancer-causing volatile organic compounds like formaldehyde and benzene. (Those NASA researchers were looking for ways to effectively detoxify the air of space station environments.) Later, research found that soil microorganisms in potted plants also play a part in cleaning indoor air.

So, is that experiment still viable now or has pollution worsened to such a degree that indoor plants have become incompetent? Let's find out. 

Luz Claudio, a professor of environmental medicine and public health at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai has reviewed the research on the air purifying capability of indoor plants. She found that house plants are indeed capable of removing volatile chemical toxins from the air “under laboratory conditions.” 

But in a home or  office space—the notion that incorporating a few plants can purify air doesn’t have much hard science to back it up.

Stanley Kays, a professor emeritus of horticulture at the University says that, most research efforts to date—including the NASA study—placed indoor plants in small, sealed environments in order to assess how much air-scrubbing power they possessed. But those studies aren’t really applicable to what happens in a house.

But, not all is bad news. While house plants may not be effective in purifying air, they do have other benefits. These plants are said to effect stress levels and bring about a change in one's mental well being. So, it's not time to stop caring for those plants yet!

Innocent bystander shot in Times Square in broad daylight,"An innocent bystander was struck by a stray bullet in Times Square late Sunday afternoon, police sources said — mere feet from where a 4-year-old girl and two others were struck by gunfire last month.

The 21-year-old man was walking with his family outside the Marriott hotel on West 45th Street and Broadway when he was hit with a ricocheted bullet just after 5:15 p.m., according to the sources and NYPD.

Sources said a relative who was walking with the man — who was visiting the Big Apple from upstate New York — pulled the slug from his arm and gave it to police.

The broad-daylight violence erupted amid a dispute between two groups — with one man opening fire.

Investigators are looking into the possibility that the fight had something to do with CD peddling in the area, according to sources.

The victim was taken to Bellevue Hospital and is expected to survive, police said.

Trump Organization attorneys given Monday deadline to persuade prosecutors not to file charges,"Prosecutors in New York have given former president Donald Trump’s attorneys a deadline of Monday afternoon to make any final arguments as to why the Trump Organization should not face criminal charges over its financial dealings, according to two people familiar with the matter.
That deadline is a strong signal that Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. (D) and New York Attorney General Letitia James (D) — now working together, after each has spent more than two years investigating Trump’s business — are considering criminal charges against the company as an entity.
Earlier this year, Vance convened a grand jury in Manhattan to consider indictments in the investigation. No entity or individual has been charged in the investigations thus far, and it remains possible that no charges will be filed.
Prosecutors have shown interest in whether Trump’s company used misleading valuations of its properties to deceive lenders and taxing authorities, and in whether taxes were paid on fringe benefits for company executives, according to court documents and people familiar with the investigations.
The two people familiar with the deadline set for Trump’s attorneys spoke on the condition of anonymity to disclose private conversations. Under New York law, prosecutors may file charges against corporations in addition to individuals.
Last Thursday, lawyers working for Trump personally and for the Trump Organization met virtually with prosecutors to make the case that charges were not warranted. Meetings like these are common in financial investigations, allowing defense attorneys a chance to present evidence before prosecutors make a decision on whether to seek charges.

Thursday’s meeting was first reported by the New York Times. 
Spokespeople for Vance and James declined to comment on Sunday, as did an attorney for Trump, Ronald Fischetti, and an attorney for the Trump Organization, Alan Futerfas.
[What we know — and don’t know — about New York’s Trump investigations]
People familiar with the probe confirmed to The Washington Post that prosecutors were looking at charging the Trump Organization as an entity, as well as Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg, following Weisselberg’s refusal to assist in the investigation.

Five Burning Questions The New York Giants Need To Answer This Summer,"The New York Giants are set to open training camp one month from today at their East Rutherford, New Jersey headquarters.

While there is growing optimism that the team is in a position to potentially challenge for a playoff spot, there are still several questions that need to be played out.

Is the offensive line going to be all right?

That’s what the coaching staff and front office seem to believe, and for proof of that, look no further at how the team has declined to get into bidding wars for veterans such as Trai Turner and Morgan Moses, who have become available on the market.

No, the Giants are willing to let their five young offensive linemen—Andrew Thomas, Shane Lemieux, Nick Gates, Will Hernandez, and Matt Peart—continue cutting their teeth.

And should any of those five struggle, the Giants have set up a veteran offensive line of backups behind them—Kenny Wiggins, Nate Solder, Zach Fulton, Jonotthan Harrison, and Chad Slade.

The Giant shave also increased their coaching resources for that units, starting with the hiring of Rob Sale as the main position coach.

Head coach Joe Judge also hired Pat Flaherty, Tom Coughlin’s offensive line coach during his time with the Giants, as a consultant and re-assigned Freddie Kitchens from tight ends coach to senior offensive assistant.

Offensive coordinator Jason Garrett said he was encouraged by how the offensive line responded during the OTAs and minicamps this spring.

“Seems like the guys have done a good job picking up some of the new techniques that we are trying to teach or some of the different things we are trying to do with our scheme and the guys have handled it well,” he said.

Of course, that progress was made without the pads. The true test will come when the Giants participate in their two scheduled joint practices coming up against the Browns and Patriots, two very key preseason weeks for the team to ascertain if their offensive line is indeed going to be okay for the upcoming season.

Competing events make their marks on LGBTQ+ Pride Day in New York,"For the second consecutive year, the lingering pandemic consigned New York's annual Pride march to the virtual world on Sunday, even as its alter-ego, the Queer Liberation March, took its edgier message through the streets of Manhattan.

The NYC Pride march, the city's marquee LGBTQ+ event now in its 51st year, became a made-for-TV production as a cautionary measure to prevent coronavirus infections, which have dropped sharply as the number of people vaccinated has grown.

Only a small number of guests were invited to the group's three-block areas where floats and musical acts paraded for the cameras, but organizer Sue Doster said ""something in the millions"" of viewers were expected to tune in.

Guests included Brandon Wolf, a survivor of the June 2016 mass shooting at the Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, who has since become an advocate for LGBTQ rights legislation.

“Six days after the shooting, we had a funeral service for my best friend and I made a promise to him that day that I would never stop fighting for a world that he would be proud of,” he told ABC, which aired the event.

“We've made incredible progress in equality across the country, but trans people are under attack,” he added.

HIV/AIDS expert Dr Demetre Daskalakis, one of the event's grand marshals, urged all LGBTQ+ community members to get tested frequently for the virus.

“At the end of the day, HIV is just a virus, and we have the ability to prevent it and to treat it,” said Daskalakis, who is director of the Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

MARCHING FOR 'LIBERATION AND JUSTICE'

Meanwhile, thousands of people organized by the Reclaim Pride Coalition, whose parade began as a protest to the Pride march two years ago, marched more than 30 blocks down New York's Seventh Avenue with rainbow flags and signs that included ""Liberation and Justice.""

Coalition cofounder Jay W. Walker said the group was hoping to draw up to 70,000 marchers.

"Trump Ohio Rally Update- New Year, Old False Allegations","Trump opened his score-settling summer tour with a rally before thousands of supporters in Ohio, returning to his familiar script of grievances, exaggerated claims and support for loyal Republicans.

The gathering outside Cleveland was Trump’s first public event to back candidates he favors for the 2022 midterms and work to unseat the 10 GOP members of Congress who voted to impeach him for his role in inciting the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.

In an address that lasted about 90 minutes, Trump said that everything he “set up was going down the tubes” and repeated several times his false claim that the 2020 election was stolen from him, as he recounted at length the record of his administration, and slammed that of President Joe Biden.

In a litany of false claims about election fraud, most of which were thrown out of numerous courts, Trump said he was “ashamed of the Supreme Court,” to which he nominated three of its nine justices.

While several elected Republicans in Ohio, including Portman and Governor Mike DeWine, skipped the rally, Trump was joined by Georgia Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Ohio Representative Jim Jordan and South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem.

Man in Spiderman outfit meets Pope at Vatican.,"Matteo Villardita, reached out and touched Francis, who wore no mask against COVID-19, on the back on an arm as he greeted the pontiff.

While Pope Francis is usually the star at Vatican gatherings, Spider-Man, or at least an Italian who dresses up like the character, was the attention-grabber among the public lined up in rows during the pontiff’s weekly Wednesday audience.

Matteo Villardita, 28, dons the comic-book and movie super-hero outfit to cheer up hospitalized children, like those at the Vatican’s pediatric hospital which he planned to visit later on Wednesday.

"Why Democrats want to avoid ""defund the police"" talk","Last year, ""defund the police"" was a slogan that gained currency during the nationwide protests after the killing of George Floyd by a police officer. The protests wanted the governments to divest the funds from police departments and reallocating them to for public safety and community support.

As more people from the Black community were killed in the hands of the police in several states, ""defund the police"" became a rallying cry. Many Democrats and progressives chimed in with their support.

But one year down the line, many Democrats are now cautious about the term, and many in fact, want to avoid it altogether.

The Republican party, which found an opening, has been hammering the sitting and potential Democratic candidates for the 2022 mid-term elections accusing them of being soft on crime.

Take the case of Senator Marco Rubio from Florida. As soon as Democratic Rep. Val Demings, former police officer, entered Florida's Senate race, he has been on the offensive accusing Demings of support the ""defund the police"" calls.

Demings' campaign had to jump to her defense immediately. It shared a photo of the congressional representative in her police chief uniform and quoted Demings as saying that since Black and Hispanic communities were hit the hardest by crime, they ""don't want to defund the police, they just want to be treated with dignity and respect.""

The Republicans have statistics on their side to argue against reducing funds to the police.  According to the latest figures, major cities in America suffered a 33 percent increase in homicides in 2020. The numbers for the first three months of 2021 saw a 24 percent increase in the homicide rate and a 22 percent rise in gun assaults over 2020s first quarter. [https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/biden-plan-fight-violent-crime-spike-calls-more-cops-so-ncna1272311]

 Democrats such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rep. Jamaal Bowman, and Rep. Gregory Meeks have all come out to support more funds for the police, emphasizing the importance of fighting rising crime.

"After pandemic free-for-all, parents struggle to reinstate screen-time rules","The week after Rebecca Grant took away her kids’ video games for a month, after a year of relaxed pandemic rules, her 10-year-old son was livid. He gave her the silent treatment, mostly ignoring her except to spit out a hurtful “I don’t love you” one night at bedtime.
The ban wasn’t an easy decision for Grant. The 46-year-old mom of two from Fremont, Calif., did hours of research and read multiple books from parenting experts. She joined Facebook groups for families in similar situations and closely watched her children’s behavior, which had been worrisome for a while. Still, she was caught off guard by the reaction.
“He was really not taking it well,” Grant said. “In a way, it reinforced my decision. He’s just so attached to this [video games], he’s not rational.”
After 15 months of various levels of shutdowns, families in the United States are trying to come out of a tech-filled haze for summer. It’s a chance to swap out Xbox time for bike rides with friends, or Zoom school for summer camp. But parents are discovering that subtracting screen time is much harder to do than adding it. They are facing resistance from kids accustomed to their freedom or just struggling to find alternatives to fill the time before a more normal fall school semester begins.
While businesses and child-care centers are opening up as coronavirus infection rates slow down, early data shows that the amount of time consumers spend on their screens hasn’t fallen sharply. According to research firm Similarweb, there has been a 24-second drop in the average time spent per session on the top 100 websites.
During the pandemic, limits around screen time were relaxed or put on hold altogether with the blessing of many screen-time experts. Screens prevented millions of children from falling a year behind in school and allowed many parents to continue working in and out of the house. For kids unable to see friends, options such as messaging apps and video games gave them an essential tether to their old lives.

Has the time come for the American digital dollar?,"The American dollar is the world's reserve currency and also the most widely used currency in international transactions. The Fed is now embarking on something that could have a worldwide impact. American digital dollar could become the primary reserve digital currency in the world.

A digitized version of the dollar with no need for the bank as an intermediary has been discussed for a while. It has picked up speed ever since the cryptocurrencies like bitcoin made their presence felt. A digital dollar would bring more stability, and it would be equal to the legal tender, but in a digital form. [https://www.politico.com/news/2021/06/12/fed-remake-us-dollar-493548]

China is one of the first major economies to announce a prototype Central bank digital currency (CBDC), and other countries, especially the U.S., don't want to be left behind in the technology-driven digital cash.

CBDC could open doors to millions of low-income Americans to join the financial system in which they don't need a bank account. With the use of their mobile phone, they can get Social Security payments and other benefits that the governments may offer. They could also make payments through it.

While the central banks of major countries consider digital cash, critics say that it may have implications for privacy as it would be easy for the government to track transactions which may not be the case when it is in normal cash. Digital currencies, especially in the U.S., may have to ensure that digital currency users will be provided the same privacy protections as others. Another fear is that it may undermine the currencies of smaller countries as digital cash could become the primary reserve currency online. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/06/01/proceed-with-caution-central-bank-digital-currency/]

Many banks that may lose business to digital currencies say that they may lead to unintended consequences and that transactions could negatively influence the economies. But with China pulling ahead, the U.S. may not want the digital yuan to gain influence. It will be the American dollar, whether it is in hard currency or digital cash.

Dangerous escalation: Indian Air Force base attacked with explosive-leden drones,"In a first of its kind attack in India, two improvised explosive devices were dropped on an Air Force base in Jammu. Security sources said the devices missed a hanger where choppers are parked, by a few meters. Needle of suspicion is hoovering over Pakistan-based jehadist groups as last year Indian intelligence agencies had received inputs that  terrorist groups were fiddling with an idea to use to drones to carry out attacks inside India. 

It is still not clear whether the drone or drones, as there were two devices that exploded,  were GPS-guided or were being flown manually with the help a camera mounted on it. Jammu Air Force base is just 14 kms away from Pakistan border which makes it entirely possible that drones may have come from across the border. 

Terror outfit ISIS toyed with the idea of using drones to drop upto 2kG explosives almost seven years back. And it's operatives managed to fabricate one with the help of cheap Chinese components. 

However in India drones so far were used by Pakistan-based operatives to drop weapons and narcotics inside bordering districts of Punjab. It's difficult to detect drones from normal radars due to their miniature size and low altitude flight. 

Dangers from low flying drones were being discussed inside Indian security establishment for the last few years and some investment was also made in hi-tech equipments to detect drones near  Indian civilian and military installations but they are very costly and deploying them at India-Pakistan line of control and border areas further down in Jammu and Punjab is going to be very expensive excercise.

Last year, Iranian insurgents targeted Saudi oil facilities Abqaiq and Khurais and it led to almost five percent decrease in global output of oil. 


For terrorists, the low cost of using drones make it an attractive proposition from them and Jammu attack shows that challenges for Indian security establishment has increased manifold.",jammu drone attack

Remembering Zora Neale Hurston of Harlem Renaissance!,"Three are hundreds of pioneers across the globe who have made our stories significant. Some of them wrote for us, some suffered unspeakable tortures, and some others gave their lives for our cause. 

Writer and anthropologist Zora Neale Hurston was a fixture of the Harlem Renaissance and author of the masterwork 'Their Eyes Were Watching God.'

Who Was Zora Neale Hurston?

Zora Neale Hurston became a fixture of New York City's Harlem Renaissance, due to her novels like Their Eyes Were Watching God and shorter works like ""Sweat."" She was also an outstanding folklorist and anthropologist who recorded cultural history, as illustrated by her Mules and Men. Hurston died in poverty in 1960, before a revival of interest led to posthumous recognition of her accomplishments.


Early Life

Hurston was born on January 7, 1891, in Notasulga, Alabama. Her birthplace has been the subject of some debate since Hurston herself wrote in her autobiography that she was born in Eatonville, Florida. However, according to many other sources, she took some creative license with that fact. She probably had no memories of Notasulga, having moved to Florida as a toddler. Hurston was also known to adjust her birth year from time to time as well. Her birthday, according to Zora Neale Hurston: A Life in Letters (1996), may not be January 7, but January 15.


Hurston was the daughter of two formerly enslaved people. Her father, John Hurston, was a pastor, and he moved the family to Florida when Hurston was very young. Following the death of her mother, Lucy Ann (Potts) Hurston, in 1904, and her father's subsequent remarriage, Hurston lived with an assortment of family members for the next few years.

"Forced to work at 6, this single mom so far rescued 9000 child labourers","At the age of six, when most children begin going to school, Anuradha Bhonsale from Kolhapur, Maharashtra began taking up domestic work. She would accompany her mother to different houses, where she was washing utensils instead of learning how to hold a pencil. Sweeping replaced outdoor games and recess was replaced by a nap due to work fatigue, a detailed report in the portal the better India said. (website www.betterindia.com) 

Meanwhile, both her parents earned just enough to afford a basic meal. So other necessities like access to healthcare and education were only a distant dream.
Anuradha believed every child was destined to work, until she saw an employer’s child in a school uniform with shiny colours and holding a tiffin box. While she worked obediently to impress her mother, life seemed unfair to her.
One day, she finally gathered courage and expressed her feelings of wanting to go to school to one of her employers, who agreed to sponsor her education and stationery. She was Anuradha’s first guardian angel.

“Over the last 30 years, there have been several kind souls who believed in me and helped me reach where I am today. They inspired me to help destitute children who are forced into child labour at the cost of their childhood and education,” Anuradha, who has rescued 9,000 child labourers, tells The Better India.

Anuradha, who has a postgraduate degree in social work, began her professional career in the 1990s with the Social Work Department of the Bajaj Auto Company, followed by the Verala Development Society. For the last 24 years, she has been working at Avani, an NGO that is fighting social evil practices such as child labour, female infanticide and child trafficking.

As part of the NGO, the 52-year-old has rescued children, brought changes at the policy level and conducted innumerable rallies to draw people’s attention.","work, child labour"
Covid-19: How did the virus go out of control in Sydney?,"Things seemed under control, with officials in Sydney expressing confidence in their contact tracing system and early intervention. But the Delta variant of the coronavirus has proven elusive, with the city administration feeling that it may be spreading faster than expected.

The result is that a strict two-week lockdown has been announced for Australia's largest city and the surrounding areas. [https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2021/06/25/sydney-goes-into-partial-lockdown-as-it-struggles-to-contain-covid-19-delta-variant-outbreak]

New South Wales and Sydney authorities thought contact tracing and isolation would bring the contagion under control, but that hasn't happened. As chains of transmission increased and contact tracing was no longer possible, the city went into lockdown.

Gladys Berejiklian, the state premier, admitted that the Delta variant was spreading too fast, and that there was no alternative to a lockdown. While there were calls for lockdown when the initial cases of Delta variant came to light, Berejiklian said that since all the cases had known contact, there was no threat, but once and that is why they decided against a lockdown. But once ""mystery cases"" started appearing and growing, there was no other way.

The latest outbreak of the Delta variant has been traced to a limousine driver when a couple that traveled in the car became the first cases of Covid-19 in 40 days in New South Wales. two local COVID-19 cases in 40 days.

Ever since the Bondi cluster came into being with the Delta variant, it has recorded more than 70 cases.

While the government is enquiring how the cases may have gone out of control, the variant's virulence and ""nastiness"" as an epidemiologist put it, could also be one of the reasons. [https://www.thequint.com/videos/explained-the-delta-variant-and-its-mutation-delta-plus]

9. Dial D for Don: Gifts from the Gulf- The Death of Asif and the Attack on Indian Parliament,"“Gifts from the Gulf"" continues…

In one such camp, he had overheard that a module was being readied to attack the Indian Parliament. Rajkot Police shared the information with the concerned agency immediately but the input seems to have got lost somewhere in the maze of intelligence bureaucracy.

 Asif made another startling revelation. His boss Aftab Ansari had paid $100,000 (then Rs 48 lakhs), out of the ransom money collected in the Burman kidnapping case, to Omar Sheikh which had later found its way to Mohammad Atta, the chief of 9/11 attackers. Aftab too had jehadi proclivities and had visited Lashkar Headquarters in Bahawalpur, Pakistan and met with Azam Cheema, the Launching Commander of LeT for India. 

On December 7, 2001 Asif Raza Khan was killed in an encounter with the Rajkot Police when he tried to escape from their custody. Perceived as a fake encounter by Aftab Ansari and Amir Raza Khan (the younger brother of the slain criminal Asif), the incident was to set off a chain reaction in the nether world of organized crime and terror. The Indian Parliament was attacked less than a week later. Though the attack was executed by operatives of the Jaish e Mohammad, not directly connected with Aftab and Asif, it was the beginning of a decade of terror strikes by new jehadi groups who indeed owed their origin to the killing of Asif Raza Khan. One such incident was to take place a little over a month later.

Is there no end for this party?,"As the Chinese Communist Party prepares to observe its 100th anniversary on July 1, the retrospectives and forecasts are pouring in. The Economist writes that the party’s secret sauce has included “ideological agility” (which enabled a pivot from the hardline rule of Mao Zedong to the patient strategy of later leaders) and, today especially, swift and tech-enhanced repression of dissent.
 
Assessing its chances of staying in power forever, the magazine writes that if the party appears monolithic to outsiders, in fact it “suffers from factionalism, disloyalty and ideological lassitude. … The moment of greatest instability is likely to be the succession” following President Xi Jinping. “No one knows who will come after Mr Xi, or even what rules will govern the transition. When he scrapped presidential term limits in 2018, he signalled that he wants to cling to power indefinitely. But that may make the eventual transfer only more unstable. Although peril for the party will not necessarily lead to the enlightened rule that freedom-lovers desire, at some point even this Chinese dynasty will end.”

[via Fareed Zakaria]

But we have seen too many of these doomsday scenarios being painted for China and the CCP in the last three decades or so. As its meteoric economic rise was on the way, many observers predicted a bubble. The BRI was dismissed as a debt trap. And same has been the case with the Xi regime. Everything has to come to an end but before that happens, how long will it be and what it’s impact on the world will be, those are the questions that should concern us. And if you are an Indian, it should bother you the most.","party, china"
"Do internet, Bitcoin really consume a lot of energy?","Browsing the internet, making a Google query, conferencing on Zoom or watching Netflix consumes a high amount of energy, as eco-conscious consumers believe. A new research estimates that the real impact of such activities may not be so high, after all. (Bitcoin, on the other hand, is an exception, according to them.)

Jonathan Koomey (an independent analyst with funding from Amazon) and Eric Masanet of University of California, Santa Barbara, do clarify that their research is NOT intended to signal everything-is-alright, something the industry would be glad to hear; but just to bring reality to wide and wild range of estimates of the impact of digital technology on the environment.

PAPER: ‘Does not compute: Avoiding pitfalls assessing the Internet's energy and carbon impacts’
https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(21)00211-7

With the pandemic, digital activities have surged and there is a valid concern about their carbon emissions. A section of researchers make well-intentioned claims, which are then amplified by activists on social media, and an impression is created that is often exaggerated. What the two researchers attempt is to introduce “some mental tools and guidelines for thinking about our increasingly digital lifestyles and the impact on energy consumption and the environment.” Some of the hyped estimates have not taken into account new developments in computer technology; in processing, memory, storage and networks, with energy-saving innovations. [https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/24/technology/computer-energy-use-study.html]

To take a concrete example, consider video streaming. Once a network is switched on, it consumes power, but the consumption does not go up or down depending on the amount of data flowing in. Eco-conscious viewers tend to put the setting at lower definition to save energy. That does not make any difference. But rest assured: There is steady improvement in technology is which is slowly making a difference.

The duo cites numbers of two large international network operators which reported a huge jump in their data traffic – but with no increase in electricity consumption in one case and substantial decrease in the other.

Bitcoin, meanwhile, is doing more and more calculation as the market grows and this remains an area of worry.

"What does 20,000-year-old coronavirus epidemic tell us about Covid-19?","A coronavirus epidemic hit East Asia about 20,000-25,000 years ago, a team of scientists has concluded. What can this deep study tell us about the latest coronavirus? First, the bad news. If the study is on the right tract, it has a dire prediction: that Covid-19 is not a short-term affair but may be prolonged. The good news is that that the ancient epidemic left its impression on the genes of people in that region, and that can offer us clues to solutions ahead.

Three kinds of coronaviruses have jumped into the humans from other species in the last 20 years, causing SARS, MERS and Covid-19. Then there are four kinds of coronaviruses, causing mild colds. They are human pathogens today, but the study probes when they might have jumped into the human system.

The study published this week in Current Biology:
https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(21)00794-6

Highlights:

* “Modern human genomes contain evolutionary information tracing back tens of thousands of years, which may help identify the viruses that have impacted our ancestors – pointing to which viruses have future pandemic potential.” So, the scientists applied evolutionary analyses to human genomic datasets to recover ‘selection events’ involving tens of human genes that interact with coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, that likely started more than 20,000 years ago. 

* Curiously, these adaptions happened only in the population ancestral to East Asia – the origin of many modern coronavirus epidemics.

* “By learning more about our ancient viral foes, our study highlights the promise of evolutionary information to better predict the pandemics of the future.”

What it means:

* David Enard, an evolutionary biologist at University of Arizona [https://enardlab.com/] who led the study, says the findings may have dire implications for the Covid-19 if it’s not brought under control soon with vaccination. “It should make us worry. What is going on right now might be going on for generations and generations,” he says. [https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/24/science/ancient-coronavirus-epidemic.html]

* The DNA map shows how the immune system responded to the coronavirus and overcame it by evolving 42 genes. That may offer new lines of research for developing medicines for the new coronavirus.

Meghdoot: The Monsoon Magic 13 IMD’s elaborate monsoon forecasting,"Do you know, how does the India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast monsoon? 

IMD has divided India into 36 meteorological subdivisions for the purpose of issuing of weather forecasts. Also, there are a number of regional offices and national level offices that coordinate with these subdivisions and run forecasting models. 

“In order to maintain the required standards and to bring about uniformity among all forecasting offices, various procedures have been formulated by IMD. These procedures also facilitate the meteorological research community to assess various actions adopted by IMD in an objective manner. These procedures include various criteria for onset and withdrawal of Indian Summer Monsoon, description of spatio-temporal distribution of rainfall during the season, formats for issuance of intensity and activity of weather forecasts and warnings, etc.,” as per the Monsoon Monograph. 

The arrival of South-West (SW) monsoon currents over the Andaman Seas, its onset over the main Indian landmass and the further advance is monitored closely. Bulletins are issued regularly by regional monitoring centres and also by the Weather Central, Pune, of course, with prior consultation to avoid sending out contradictory messages.

IMD starts by tracking the SW monsoon from May 10th onwards each year. Remember in part 2 of this series we saw when and how is monsoon onset declared over Kerala? 

Next step is to monitor and forecast rainfall owing to further advance that is based “on the occurrence of rainfall over parts / sectors of the sub-division and maintaining the spatial continuity of the northern limit of monsoon.

And then, IMD also monitors and tells us when the SW monsoon starts withdrawing and when the withdrawal is complete, before it starts monitoring onset and withdrawal of NE monsoon.

Grilled cheese sandwiches 😋,"Hello foodies!

""Never underestimate the power of a grilled cheese sandwich""

A grilled cheese sandwich, toasted sandwich, cheese toastie, or grilled cheese is a hot sandwich made with one or more varieties of cheese on bread. It is typically prepared by heating one or more slices of cheese between slices of bread, with a cooking fat such as butter, on a frying pan, griddle, or sandwich toaster, until the bread browns and the cheese melts. A grilled cheese may contain separate ingredients, though the main ingredients remain the bread and cheese.

""I have never met a problem that cheese couldn't solve""

The trick to great grilled cheese sandwiches isn’t in the ingredients, but on the stove. Achieving a golden, crusty outside and oozy inside takes a little patience: if the heat is too high, the outside will scorch before the cheese melts. Cooking the slices separately at first gives the cheese a good head start.
A grilled cheese sandwich is assembled by creating a cheese filling between two slices of bread, and is then heated until the bread browns and the cheese melts. A layer of butter or mayonnaise is sometimes added to the outside of the bread for additional flavor and texture. Some may add additional ingredients, such as peppers, tomatoes, or onions. Several different methods of heating the sandwich are used, depending on the region and personal preference. Common methods include being cooked on a griddle, fried in a pan, or made in a sandwich toaster. This last method is more common in the United Kingdom, where the sandwiches are normally called ""toasted sandwiches"" or ""toasties"", in Australia, where they are called ""jaffles"", and South Africa, where they are called “snackwiches”. Other methods such as baking in an oven or toaster oven, or in a toasting bag in an electric toaster, may be employed.
The main game in these sandwiches is of cheese - The cheesier, the better, the tastier.
The sandwich is typically served as a snack or lunchtime meal, often with a side of salad, soup, french fries, or other accompaniment.

You should try Grilled Cheese Sandwiches as they are easy to make and amazing in taste.
I have made them many times and they haven't disappointed me even once so I would recommend it to you too.","Food, grilled cheese sandwich"
"At 18 left alone with a baby on street, Annie Shiva, a  police officer 14 years later","An 18-year-old girl who was left on the streets with her 6-month-old baby after being abandoned by her husband and family has become sub inspector at Varkala police station in Keral  here. 

A true model of will power and confidence, Kanjiramkulam native Anie Siva built her life within 14 years.
When Anie Siva was a first year degree student at KNM Government College in Kanjiramkulam, she started living with her boyfriend against the will of her family. However, after having a baby, the man left her. Though she returned to her house, the family did not accept her.

With this, Anie started living with her son in the back shed of her grandmother's house. She sold curry powder and soap at households, worked as insurance agent, delivered essentials to houses, prepared projects and records for students and also helped vendors in festival grounds selling lime juice and ice cream.

Amid this busy life, Anie managed to complete graduation in Sociology. She kept moving from place to place with her little boy Shivasurya. She also cut her hair and looked like a man. So, the people thought she was either father or brother of Shivasurya.

In 2014, Anie joined a coaching centre in Thiruvananthapuram to appear for women SI test as advised by a friend. She also appeared for the test for women police.

 She got appointed as woman police in 2016 and cleared the SI test in 2019. She was first appointed as SI in Varkala station on June 25, 2021.
Narrating her life, Anie Siva wrote on Facebook: ""I managed not to get mentally derailed somehow. After all these struggles and hardships, when a woman get her life on track, people show mercy and keep spreading lies about them. So, my son and I live here as an elder brother and younger brother.""

"Is patriarchy, in all its sense, truly that bad?","""Now, by definition, patriarchy is a society in which the males have a dominant role and the females are submissive.

By definition and also in the history of the world, patriarchy has been a source of distress to women (to put that across mildly) but would you also consider for a second that patriarchy (I am not speaking of the oppressive societies that dominated the eras before the 20th century), in the contemporary sense, may favor women?""

Pakistan: Govt gets walkover in key National Assembly session,"For the second consecutive year the Imran Khan led government on Saturday got a walkover in the National Assembly regarding the passage of the budget when as many as 49 demands of its demands for grants worth over Rs 3 trillion were approved and 967 cut motions were rejected by a majority vote, despite the latter making tall claims of making every effort to block the passage of the budget in parliament.

The lack of will on the part of the opposition parties could be gauged from the fact that a majority of its members, including Opposition Leader Shehbaz Sharif, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and Asif Ali Zardari, were absent from the house proceedings, thereby allowing the government smooth sailing during the crucial phase of the budget session, Dawn reported.

The opposition benches in the National Assembly looked deserted with most seats lying vacant. Despite their strength, the opposition did not challenge even a single ruling of the chair on the voice vote on the demands for grants.

Just weeks before the budget presentation, the opposition leaders, including Mr Sharif and Mr Bhutto-Zardari, had repeatedly said that they would not let the government pass the budget from the National Assembly and they would do whatever they could to achieve this goal.

This is the second consecutive year that the opposition had allowed the government such a walkover as during the last budget session, the two major opposition parties — PML-N and PPP — had reached an understanding with the government that the opposition members would submit the cut motions, but they would withdraw them without a vote count.

The behind-the-scenes agreement between the government and the two major opposition parties of Pakistan had been reached while discussing the standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the budget session in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic.

Tour de France: How many calories will the winner burn?,"Imagine you begin pedaling from the start of Stage 17 of this year’s Tour de France. First, you would bike approximately 70 miles (112 km) with a gradual increase in elevation of around 1,300 feet (400 m). But you’ve yet to hit the fun part: the Hautes-Pyrénées mountains. Over the next 40 miles (64 km) you would have to climb three mountain peaks with a net increase of a mile (1.6 km) in elevation. On the fittest day of my life, I might not even be able to finish Stage 17 – much less do it in anything remotely close to the five hours or so the winner will take to finish the ride. And Stage 17 is just one of 21 stages that must be completed in the 23 days of the tour.

I am a sports physicist, and I’ve modeled the Tour de France for nearly two decades using terrain data – like what I described for Stage 17 – and the laws of physics. But I still cannot fathom the physical capabilities needed to complete the world’s most famous bike race. Only an elite few humans are capable of completing a Tour de France stage in a time that’s measured in hours instead of days. The reason they’re able to do what the rest of us can only dream of is that these athletes can produce enormous amounts of power. Power is the rate at which cyclists burn energy and the energy they burn comes from the food they eat. And over the course of the Tour de France, the winning cyclist will burn the equivalent of roughly 210 Big Macs.

Cycling is a game of watts

To make a bicycle move, a Tour de France rider transfers energy from his muscles, through the bicycle and to the wheels that push back on the ground. The faster a rider can put out energy, the greater the power. This rate of energy transfer is often measured in watts. Tour de France cyclists are capable of generating enormous amounts of power for incredibly long periods of time compared to most people.

TN announces Rs 3 cr for athletes who win gold in Tokyo Olympics,"Tamil Nadu chief minister, M.K. Stalin has announced a cash prize of Rs 3 crore for those athletes who wins gold in the Tokyo Olympics which is starting from July 23.

The chief minister made the announcement at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium here on Saturday while addressing athletes and sportspersons at a special Covid vaccination camp held for them.

The silver medal winners will be provided Rs 2 crore as cash prize and the bronze medal winners Rs 1 crore, he said.

Nethra Kumanan, Varun Thakkar and K.C. Ganapathy (sailing), G. Sathian and A. Sharath Kamal (table tennis), C.A. Bhavani Devi (fencing) and Paralympian T. Mariappan have qualified for the Olympics from Tamil Nadu.

Stalin reminiscenced his days as a sportsperson in his younger days and said that sports is a major connector and said that iconic athletes like Sachin Tendulkar, Karnam Malleswari, M.S. Dhoni, P.T. Usha and Milkha Singh will always be an inspiration to the generations of youngsters of the nation.

The Tamil Nadu chief minister said that the DMK in its election manifesto had promised that an Olympic Academy will be established in four zones of the state and added that the promise made in the election manifesto would be fulfilled.

He said that a world-class gym and a state of the art facility to scientifically aid sportspersons will be set up immediately and that his government was committed to promote and support sports and sportspersons.

Stalin said, “If a Dhoni hit a sixer or a Ronaldo scores a goal, the audience in the stadium and those watching on television feel it as a personal achievement.”

The CM also said, “Life is a game, it is said, and there are several people in this country who treat politics also as a game but sports should be taken seriously and sportspersons are an inspiration for generations to come and you should keep that in mind.”

Jharkhand preparing for Covid third wave; each district to have 20-bed PICU facility,"Preparation to tackle the anticipated third wave of coronavirus has gained momentum in Jharkhand. Chief Minister Hemant Soren is personally monitoring every development and issuing the directive to the concerned officials.

According to the information, 20 beds Paediatric Intensive Care Units (PICU) are being established in every district across the state. This time the state government is focusing on the special facilities for the children. The Chief Minister has directed the officials to establish child-friendly ICU beds in the government hospitals at the earliest.

The Chief Minister has also directed the officials to equip child wards with modern medical equipment so that patients in rural areas to be able to access the best possible and free of cost treatment in their locality.

Apart from general child wards, dedicated child wards are also being developed. These wards are equipped with infant ventilators, paediatric ventilators, Bubble CPAP, Radiant warmers, Oxygen supply facility and other necessary facilities.

Interestingly, the PICU wards are being painted with different kinds of child-friendly paintings.

The curtains, bed sheets and covers used in PICU wards are colourful and attractive to create a comfortable environment for children. Walls have been painted with illustrations of cartoon characters.

Each district administration started working on the development of a dedicated child ward. Many districts have already completed the development of at least one such facility and are in the process of developing other units in rural areas. Districts like Koderma, Ranchi, Dhanbad, Jamshedpur, Gumla, Latehar, Giridih have already completed the work related to the PICUs.

In Ranchi, a 27-bed PICU ward has been established and work is in progress for at least 40 more such facilities. In the East Singhbhum district, work for the development of 30 PICU beds is in progress. A 20-bed PICU facility has been completed in the Koderma district. Giridih and Hazaribag districts are developing 130-bed child ward facilities across different Community Health Centres and Sadar Hospital of the district. The work for 70 PICU beds facilities is near completion in Dhanbad and Khunti districts.

"Mayawati rules out tie with AIMIM for UP, Uttarakhand polls","Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) president Mayawati has said that her party would contest the Assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand alone.

In a series of tweets on Sunday, she ruled out the talks about the BSP joining hands with Asaduddin Owaisi’s AIMIM in Uttar Pradesh.

“This news is being circulated that the AIMIM and BSP will fight the upcoming assembly elections in UP together. This news is completely false, misleading and baseless. There is not even an iota of truth in this, and BSP vehemently denies it,” she said.

She further said that the BSP would like to clarify that, except for Punjab, the party will contest the Assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand alone.

The BSP and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) have allied to contest the 2022 Punjab Assembly elections.

The BSP, which stormed to power in 2007 by winning 206 seats, was left with just 80 seats in 2012.

In 2014, Mayawati’s party did not win a single Lok Sabha seat, and in the 2017 Uttar Assembly elections, it bagged only 19 seats.

With BSP’s support base dwindling over the years, the BJP and the Samajwadi Party have been trying to woo the Dalit voters ahead of the upcoming Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections in 2022.

In April, Akhilesh Yadav announced that Samajwadi Party (SP) will constitute a Baba Saheb Vahini named after Dalit icon Dr B.R. Ambedkar.

The Baba Saheb Vahini aims to bring Dalits into the Samajwadi fold and assure them protection against social exploitation.

The BJP has now announced that it will build a memorial in the name of Ambedkar.

The SP and BSP were allies in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

However, immediately after the Lok Sabha elections, Mayawati snapped ties with the party announcing that her party would never ally with SP again.

Modi’s hand on Kashmir forced by geopolitical churning,"In today's Deccan Herald, I write on the geopolitical churn and international pressure that has forced Modi's hand on Kashmir and resulted in the meeting with leaders of Kashmiri political parties on Thursday:

""The Modi government is being pulled apart by its external projection of a liberal democracy in the Nehruvian mould and by the reality of its domestic politics which is majoritarian and authoritarian. This contradiction has amplified the challenges thrown up in this period of deep geopolitical churn. Battered by the second wave of the pandemic during a severe economic downturn, a weakened government has no choice but to accept geopolitical realities and try to cut its losses by responding to external pressure. That is how far things have moved since 2009. Modi’s meeting with Kashmiri parties on Thursday was not about a summer thaw in the chill of the Valley. If anything, it was an acknowledgement of this cold reality.""

‘Upcycling’ promises to turn food waste into your next meal,"How would you like to dig into a “recycled” snack? Or take a swig of juice with “reprocessed” ingredients made from other food byproducts? Without the right marketing, these don’t sound like the most appetizing options.

Enter “upcycling.” That’s the relatively recent term for the age-old concept of using low-valued foods or food processing byproducts to generate new food products. Time-honored examples of this concept include sausages made from meat scraps and jams or jellies made from overripe fruit. In many cases, this waste would have otherwise been used as animal feed or sent to the compost pile.

The Upcycled Food Association defines upcycled foods as those that “use ingredients that otherwise would not have gone to human consumption, are procured and produced using verifiable supply chains, and have a positive impact on the environment.” An official definition may allow manufacturers to market to a target audience and encourage consumers and food processors to consider upcycled products. The Association launched a new Upcycled Certification Standard in 2021. Soon enough you may notice an upcycled label on items at the grocery store.

Food waste is a monumental problem, and this nascent trend, with a buzzy new name designed to appeal to consumers, could help. As an economist and a food engineer, we’ve worked with food companies to minimize waste and find markets for underutilized or otherwise trashed food items. Here’s how upcycling works.

Massive amounts of food get wasted

Globally, more than one-third of all current food production will be lost or wasted somewhere between the farm or ranch and the consumer’s garbage can. Food “losses” may be due to improper handling or storage conditions on the farm or in the food distribution process, whereas food “waste” often results from limited retail shelf life or consumers simply not making use of perishable products before they spoil in the fridge.

Worldwide annual loss estimates for highly perishable crops, such as fruits and vegetables, exceed 20%, with certain leafy greens and tropical fruits exceeding 40%.

The next day Bela claims she saw a flying saucer at night and was beamed up into it. There she met five tall and slender aliens. She connected with one, who was willing to take her away. However, she didn't say yes because she wasn't ready to leave Earth behind forever, so the aliens returned her to her home. She says she now hopes to normalize interspecies dating.

The behind-the-scenes people and organizations connecting science and decision-making,"The role of science in society has never been more important. Scientific perspectives are critical for understanding complex issues such as the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, access to higher education and systemic racism.

The Biden administration promises to “listen to the science” and “marshal the forces of science.”

But how does scientific information actually make its way from researcher to policymaker? We study the individuals and organizations that serve as intermediaries between these two worlds. After reviewing hundreds of cases, we found intermediaries not only help translate science but often facilitate two-way relationships between scientists and policymakers.

Getting knowledge to policymakers

Intermediaries are funded through many sources. They can be based at universities, nonprofit organizations or in government. Intermediaries have always existed. However, scientists, policymakers and funders are increasingly recognizing their value – and the need to professionalize their role.

Sometimes individuals or organizations naturally broker information between scientists and policymakers, even though it may not be a stated part of their job.

In Michigan, county-level intermediate school districts are governmental entities that provide administrative and instructional resources to local school districts. These administrative bodies know a lot about the school districts they serve and often function as intermediaries between local districts and researchers. For example, one intermediate school district recently provided information about a research-based literacy program to help a local school district make a curriculum decision.

Other times, intermediaries are hired as part of a project or within an organization. While a researcher can always play this role, it helps to have staff dedicated to connecting science to decision-makers. Building relationships that last takes time – and academia often doesn’t reward researchers for engaging with policy.

The Gund Institute for Environment at the University of Vermont has employed one of us as an intermediary for the past two years. The behind-the-scenes work has included tasks such as arranging for scientists to testify to legislative committees and facilitating meetings between researchers and leaders of relevant federal programs.

The work of intermediaries can have real-world impacts on timely issues, from food insecurity related to COVID-19 to water quality initiatives to charter school policies.

Sajan Prakash makes us proud,"Sajan  Prakash became the first Indian swimmer to qualify for the Olympics with an ‘A’ standard time, clocking 1:56:38 seconds in the men's 200m butterfly event at the Sette Colli Trophy in Rome, Italy.

ash's direct qualification means Srihari Nataraj, who missed the 'A' the 100m men's backstroke by 0.05s in Rome on Friday, will not be competing in the Tokyo Games despite being nominated for the Universality places.

The Universality quota allows one male and one female competitor from a country to participate in the Olympics, provided no other swimmer from the same gender qualifies for the Games or receives a FINA invite based on his or her Olympic Selection time (B time).",olympics
England Vs Germany: Can it get bigger than this?,"Well many in Europe and elsewhere on the plant, it is imposed to think of football rivalries that are bigger than England versus Germany.

The tie, steeped in decades of history, has thrown up memorable moments, tears, and more penalty shootouts for English fans to care for over the years.

The two nations are set to write another chapter in this classic fixture on Tuesday as they compete for a place in the quarterfinals of Euro 2020.

With Germany -- a World Cup winner in 2014 -- very much holding the upper hand over its old enemy in recent times, the rivalry remains very strong in England and it's not lost on German fans either. 

There is nothing to choose between the teams over their previous 32 meetings, with 13 wins each, though England have the slight edge in goals scored, 51 to Germany's 42.

• Current England head coach Gareth Southgate was a pivotal figure in their last UEFA European Championship knockout meeting, missing England's sixth penalty as Germany prevailed 6-5 in the shoot-out after a 1-1 draw at Wembley in the EURO '96 semi-finals. Alan Shearer had given England a third-minute lead; Stefan Kuntz levelled for Germany 13 minutes later. Germany went on to beat the Czech Republic 2-1 via a golden goal in the Wembley final.

• England gained a measure of revenge at UEFA EURO 2000, Shearer scoring the only goal against the holders in Charleroi on Matchday 2, although neither England nor Germany would progress to the knockout rounds.

• The only other EURO fixtures between the sides came in the 1972 quarter-finals, Günter Netzer – who scored the second goal from the penalty spot – inspiring West Germany to a 3-1 first-leg win at Wembley with Uli Hoeness and Gerd Müller also on target. The second leg finished goalless, West Germany going on to lift the trophy for the first time.

• Their most significant meeting came at Wembley in the 1966 FIFA World Cup final, Geoff Hurst scoring a hat-trick as England ran out 4-2 winners after extra time.

"18. Khaki Files: In a rare feat in history of Indian Police, all 15 accused were convicted","What the Doctor Ordered Continues ……….

The conviction of all fifteen accused individuals with sentences to life imprisonment in a single case was a rare occurrence in the history of the Indian police.

Dr Ansari and his co-conspirators are today in Ajmer Central Jail serving their life sentences. On 6 April 2000, Azam Ghauri, one of the three masterminds, was killed in an encounter with Hyderabad  Police in Jagtiyal, now in Telengana state. Seventeen years after the killing of Azam Ghauri, the Delhi Police arrested the third mastermind, Abdul Karim Tunda, at the Indo-Nepal border on 16 August 2017. He is currently lodged in Ajmer Jail and is still undergoing trial in the serial train blast cases of 6 December 1993.

This was one of the major cases I was associated with during my nine-year stint in the CBI. The unearthing of the countrywide network of a terror group, whose existence was, until then, unknown to any state police force or to any intelligence agency, has been a matter of great personal satisfaction. 

Besides the resolution of the serial train blast cases, the mystery behind over forty intermittent bomb blasts in and around Mumbai, including the blasts at gurdwaras and police stations, was solved. A deadly terror group had been identified and put away and scores of people saved from deadly terror attacks.

17. Khaki Files: Arrest of real culprits raised questions on earlier claims of solving cases,"What the Doctor Ordered Continues ……….

Uncomfortable questions were directed at several people in positions of authority, demanding explanations for the intelligence failure. Indeed, a nationwide terror network had struck at different locations in a well-orchestrated attack without anyone getting even a whiff of either the likelihood of these strikes or the identities of the perpetrators. 

Some people in government, especially in the intelligence agencies—both state and Central—owed the people an explanation.


This incident, coupled with earlier blasts perpetrated by the same group, called into question the authorities’ claim of having resolved the serial bomb blast cases that had occurred only months earlier in March 1993, further adding to the sense of fear and panic. 

Many detractors of Mumbai Police contended that if the real perpetrators of the crime had been arrested or identified, how were blasts still occurring in and around Mumbai? 

The significance of the date of the attacks—6 December 1993—was not lost on anyone.

After the arrest of Dr Ansari and the disclosures made by him, we in the STF conducted simultaneous raids across the country in which fifteen other associates were either arrested or identified. These operations were conducted in close coordination with the local police of Lucknow and Rae Bareli in Uttar Pradesh, the Dausa Police in Rajasthan and the Gulbarga Police in Karnataka. 

During the investigation, evidence such as train reservation forms, entries and signatures in hotel registers, eyewitness accounts, confessions recorded under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (referred to as TADA), and explosive material and weapons from the individuals accused were collected. A charge sheet was filed in August 1994 in a TADA court in Ajmer. 

Earlier, all the bomb blast cases had been clubbed together and were being investigated by us as a single case. The trial of this case dragged on for nearly ten years and the final court order came on 28 February 2004, convicting all accused and sentencing them to life imprisonment.* O.P. Chhatwal, my SP in Delhi, played a major role in marshalling the evidence, presenting it in court and securing the convictions.
